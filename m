Ah, I think I did misundestand you. Today, you can set the fd limit to N 
and that would limit the total number of devices. But right now the user 
can set each of those N device's to have anywhere from num_queues=1 - 
128 which could be a wide range of resource use. You want something 
finer grained right?
