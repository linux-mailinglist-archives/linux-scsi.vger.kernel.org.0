This is Ñ–s not about HPB about a feature beeing a bad idea.  I explained
that at least a dozend times, and there's been no sensible counter
arguments to that but it has been merged anyway.  (FYI Zoned devices
are the obvious and old answer).

But this implementation is simply completely broken from the block
layer POV and we must not release a kernel with that brokenness in it.
