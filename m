Thanks for the reply :)

In my opinion, IOMMU is used to prevent the hardware from accessing 
arbitrary memory addresses, but it cannot prevent the hardware from 
writing a bad value into a valid memory address.
For this reason, I think that the hardware can normally access 
"fsc->command" and modify it into arbitrary value at any time, because 
IOMMU considers the address of "fsc->command" is valid for the hardware.
