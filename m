ufshcd_hba_crypto_variant_ops doesn't exist in the patchset for upstream.

We had to add ufshcd_hba_crypto_variant_ops out-of-tree to the Android common
kernels to unblock vendors implementing their drivers this year, because we
didn't know exactly what functionality they'd need.  So we just had to guess and
add ~10 different operations just in case people needed them.  (Note that some
or all of these may go away next year, once we see what was actually used.)

That's not acceptable for upstream.  For upstream we can only add variant
operations that are actually used by in-tree drivers.

So far the only hardware support actually proposed upstream are my patch for
ufs-qcom, and Stanley's patch for ufs-mediatek.  ufs-qcom only needs
->program_key(), and ufs-mediatek doesn't need any new variant op.

So, that's why only ->program_key() has been proposed upstream thus far: it's
the minimal functionality that's been demonstrated to be needed.

Of course, if someone actually posts patches to support hardware that diverges
from the UFS standard in new and "exciting" ways (whether it's another vendor's
hardware or future Qualcomm hardware) then they'll need to post any variant
operation(s) they need.  They need to be targetted to only the specific quirk(s)
needed, so that drivers don't have to unnecessarily re-implement stuff.
