Indeed, I was going to make the same point.

The only reasonable conclusion is that suspending these SD card readers 
isn't safe unless they don't contain a card -- or maybe just if the 
device file isn't open or mounted.

Although support for this sort of thing could be added to the kernel, 
for now it's best to rely on userspace doing the right thing.  The 
kernel doesn't even know which devices suffer from this problem.
