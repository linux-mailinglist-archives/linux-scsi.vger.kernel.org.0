BFQ inherited this powerful non-working scheme from CFQ, some age ago.

In more detail: if BFQ has at least one non-empty internal queue, then
is says of course that there is work to do.  But if the currently
in-service queue is empty, and is expected to receive new I/O, then
BFQ plugs I/O dispatch to enforce service guarantees for the
in-service queue, i.e., BFQ responds NULL to a dispatch request.

It would be very easy to change bfq_has_work so that it returns false
in case the in-service queue is empty, even if there is I/O
backlogged.  My only concern is: since everything has worked with the
current scheme for probably 15 years, are we sure that everything is
still ok after we change this scheme?

I'm confident it would be ok, because a timer fires if the in-service
queue does not receive any I/O for too long, and the handler of the
timer invokes blk_mq_run_hw_queues().

Looking forward to your feedback before proposing a change,
Paolo
