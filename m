Hi Bart,

No I was not aware of this. Thanks for letting me know.

However, it doesn't look like this stores the _history_ of commands that 
were already executed.

To put it in perspective, below is the output of the current command 
logging -:

This output was extracted from ramdumps after a crash.
There're custom logs that come up as well, for e.g. scaling start and 
end etc.

In a nutshell, the high-level requirements of the logging would be -:
1. Light-weight
2. Extract from ram-dumps
3. Eliminate the need to reproduce an issue as much as possible

Ftrace ticks all the boxes except 3. There's a high chance of this data 
being overwritten by other loggers. And when this happens, the issue 
needs to be reproduced with ftrace logging enabled only for ufs.

*Motivation for this logging*:

There are several (read - all) UFS device vendors who need the sequence 
of commands leading up to the specific failure. They've asked for it 
every time. They still do.

There were 2 ways of doing this - either in device or in host.

1. In-Device-:
	The device stores a ring buffer of commands that were received.
	Upon error, host sends a command to device to read this ring 	buffer 
and dumps it out or can be extracted from ramdumps. It'd not be a 
universal solution anyway and would be very vendor-specific. Difficult 
to maintain etc. May have to be added to JEDEC to standardize it.

2. In-host-:
	Ftrace was tried out and the previously highlighted issues popped up. 
Hence the need for a UFS (client)-specific implementation.

If there's a way to have a client-specific ftrace logging, it'd be the 
ideal thing to do.

How about modifying ftrace to make it client-specific?

Any suggestions to modify the current design such that it can use ftrace 
or any other better ideas or methods, please let me know.
