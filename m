This patchset addresses reports sent by Colin King to the linux-scsi
list in 20210311 based on coverity reports. There were also similar
reports from Dan Carpenter the following day. Plus syzbot (KASAN)
made a double free report. These were due to a 45 part patchset:
"sg: add v4 interface" applied to 5.13/scsi-staging recently.
Patches 1, 2 and 4 address those concerns.

Colin King sent a patch titled: "[PATCH][next] scsi: sg: Fix use of
pointer sfp after it has been kfree'd" [linux-scsi 20210311] which
should be applied.
Dan Carpenter sent a patch titled: "Re: [PATCH] scsi: sg: Fix a
warning message" [linux-scsi 20210312] regarding the use of
WARN_ONCE() which should be applied.

Patches 3, 5 and 6 are due to the author's ongoing testing.

This patchset is against MKP's repository, 5.13/scsi-staging
branch.

Douglas Gilbert (6):
  sg: sg_rq_map_kern: fix uninitialized
  sg: sg_remove_sfp_usercontext: remove NULL check
  sg: sg_rq_end_io: set SG_FRQ_ISSUED
  sg: fix double free of long scsi commands
  sg: tighten handling of struct request objects
  sg: remove debugging remnants
