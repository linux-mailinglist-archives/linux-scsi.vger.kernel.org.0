Thanks for the patches!  These are on top of my patchset
"[RFC PATCH v2 0/5] Support for hardware-wrapped inline encryption keys"
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20210916174928.65529-1-ebiggers@kernel.org),
right?  You should mention that in your cover letter, so that it's possible for
people to apply your patches for reviewing or testing, and also to provide
context about what this feature is and why it is important.

As part of that, it would be helpful to specifically mention the documentation
for hardware-wrapped keys in Documentation/block/inline-encryption.rst that I
included in my patchset.  It provides a lot of background information that your
patches are hard to understand without (at least your patches 2-4; your first
patch isn't dependent on the hardware-wrapped keys feature).

Can you include information about how your patches were tested?  That's really
important to include.

Please run './scripts/checkpatch.pl' on your patches, as recommended in
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.  It can catch a lot of issues.

Please use the imperative tense, like "add wrapped key support" rather than
"adds wrapped key support".

I'll leave some more comments on the individual patches.

- Eric
