Yep, we can work on something.
Which kernel versions are these tests run against ? I mean, do we need
to patch assuming that /usr/include/linux/ioprio.h may not exist ?

I did a quick hack replacing the internal definitions in ltp ioprio.h
with an include of the patched header file, and all is good. But that
needs to work with older kernels as well and I wonder how far back we
need to go.
