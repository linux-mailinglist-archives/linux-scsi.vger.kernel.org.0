I think it means when a vq is disabled, vhost won't process any request 
from that virtqueue.

For vDPA, it would be more complicated.

E.g for IFCVF, it just delay the setting of queue_enable when it get 
DRIVER_OK. Technically it can passthrough the queue_enable to the 
hardware as what mlx5e did.

Yes, vhost support backend capability. When userspace negotiate the new 
capability, we should depend on SET_VRING_ENABLE, if not we can do 
vhost_vq_is_enable().

It needs more thought, but the question is not specific to 
SET_VRING_ENABLE. Consider guest may zero ring address as well.

For disabling, we can simply flush the work and disable all the polls.

My understanding is that, since spec defines queue_enable, we should 
support it in vhost. And we can piggyback the delayed vq creation with 
this feature. Otherwise we will duplicate the function if we want to 
support queue_enable.

Net is something different, we can simply use SET_BACKEND to disable a 
specific virtqueue without introducing new ioctls. Notice that, net mq 
is kind of different with scsi which have a per queue pair vhost device, 
and the API allows us to set backend for a specific virtqueue.

It's up to you, if you think you should free the resources you can do that.

I think SET_VRING_ENABLE is more useful for SCSI since it have a model 
of multiple vqs per vhost device.

In this case, qemu may just disable the queues of vhost-scsi via 
SET_VRING_ENABLE and then we can free resources?
