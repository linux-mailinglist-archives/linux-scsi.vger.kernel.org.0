Hannes cleanup of EH will create a conflict with the scsi tree but can go in
through the ata tree independently so I was not planning on doing a rebase,
especially not on the scsi tree. I will notify Stephen about the conflict send
him a resolution to apply and carry for linux-next. When the 6.5 merge window
open, I will wait for the James to send the scsi PR and send my PR to Linus
after that with the conflict resolution, as usual.

So far, I do not see any big issue with that.
