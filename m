XFS has an abstract type definition for metadata that is uses to
prioritise cache reclaim (i.e. classifies what metadata is more
important/hotter) and that could easily be extended to IO hints
to indicate placement.

We also have a separate journal IO path, and that is probably the
hotest LBA region of the filesystem (circular overwrite region)
which would stand to have it's own classification as well.

We've long talked about making use of write IO hints for separating
these things out, but requiring 10+ IO hint channels just for
filesystem metadata to be robustly classified has been a show
stopper. Doing nothing is almost always better than doing placement
hinting poorly.

*cough*

We already do this in the LBA space via the filesytsem allocators.
It's often configurable and generally called "allocation policies".

Yup, XFS does this "physical locality is determined by parent
directory" separation by default (the inode64 allocation policy).
Every new directory inode is placed in a different allocation group
(LBA space) based on a rotor mechanism. All the files within that
directory are kept local to the directory (i.e. in the same AG/LBA
space) as much as possible.

Most filesystems have LBA locality policies like this because it is
highly efficient on physical seek latency limited storage hardware.
i.e. the storage hardware we've mostly been using since the early
1980s.

We could make allocation groups have different reclaim units,
but then we are talking about needing an arbitrary number of
different IO hints - XFS supports ~2^31 AGs if the filesystem is
large enough, and there's no way we're going to try to support that
many IO hints (software or hardware) in the foreseeable future.

IF devices want to try to classify related data themselves, then
using LBA locality internally to classify relationships below the
level of IO hints, then that would be a much closer match to how
filesystems have traditionally structured the data and metadata on
disk. Related data and metadata tends to get written to the same LBA
regions because that's the fastest way to access related and
metadata on seek-limited hardware.

Yeah, I know that these are SSDs we are talking about and they
aren't seek limited, but when we already have filesystem
implementations that try to clump related things to nearby LBA
spaces, it might be best to try to leverage this behaviour rather
than try to rely on kernel and userspace to correctly provide hints
about their data patterns.

Cheers,

Dave.
