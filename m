This won't happen.

As argued in https://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=162625194203635&w=2,
your previous patches avoid the request being requeued on the SCSI
queue, even with Brian's patch on top. IMO that means that the deadlock
situation analyzed earlier can't occur. If you disagree, please explain
in detail.

By not failing the path, the request can be requeued on the dm level,
and dm can decide to try the transitioning path again. But the request
wouldn't be added to the SCSI queue, because alua_prep_fn() would
prevent that. 

So, in the worst case, dm would retry queueing the request on the
transitioning path over and over again. By adding a delay, we avoid
busy-looping. This has basically the same effect as queueing on the dm
layer in the first place: the request stays queued on the dm level most
of the time. Except for the fact that the queueing would stop earlier:
as soon as the kernel notices that the path is not transitioning any
more. By not failing the dm paths, we don't depend on user space to
reinstate them, which is the right thing to do for a transitioning
state IMO.

I think Brian is right that setting transitioning paths to failed state
in dm is highly questionable.

So far, in dm-multipath, we haven't set paths to failed state because
of ALUA state transitions. We've been mapping ALUA states to priorities
instead. We don't even fail paths in ALUA "unavailable" state, so why
do it for "transitioning"?

Thanks
Martin
