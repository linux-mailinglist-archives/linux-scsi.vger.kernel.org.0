Hi Ming,

Submitting I/O to a WLUN is only one example of a use case that
activates the fair sharing algorithm for UFS devices. Another use
case is simultaneous activity for multiple data LUNs. Conventional
UFS devices typically have four data LUNs and zoned UFS devices
typically have five data LUNs. From an Android device with a zoned UFS
device:

$ adb shell ls /sys/class/scsi_device
0:0:0:0
0:0:0:1
0:0:0:2
0:0:0:3
0:0:0:4
0:0:0:49456
0:0:0:49476
0:0:0:49488

The first five are data logical units. The last three are WLUNs.

For a block size of 4 KiB, I see 144 K IOPS for queue depth 31 and
107 K IOPS for queue depth 15 (queue depth is reduced from 31 to 15
if I/O is being submitted to two LUNs simultaneously). In other words,
disabling fair sharing results in up to 35% higher IOPS for small reads
and in case two logical units are active simultaneously. I think that's
a very significant performance difference.

Thanks,

Bart.
