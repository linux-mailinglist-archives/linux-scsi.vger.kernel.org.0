Dangerous how?

fcp3:
For read operations and write operations, if the FCP_RESID_OVER bit is 
set to one, the FCP_RESID field contains the excess of the number of 
bytes required by the SCSI command to be transferred over the number of 
bytes specified by the FCP_DL field.

SAS doesn't even have the notion of residuals

srp04:
DOOVER , when set to one, indicates that the DATA-OUT RESIDUAL COUNT 
field is valid and contains the count of data bytes that could not be 
transferred from the data-out buffer because the length of the data-out 
buffer was not sufficient. The application client should examine the 
DATA-OUT RESIDUAL COUNT field in the context of the command to determine 
whether or not an error condition occurred.

iSCSI we've already covered.

In all cases, the overflow value is an _indicator_ that additional data 
is available, but was not transferred due to the lack of space.
So we will not have any buffer overflow as data is never transferred.

And in most cases an overflow is actually desired; it is a pretty common 
use pattern to send a SCSI command with a small enough buffer to return 
the length of available data, and then send the actual command knowing 
how large the buffer needs to be.
See for example scsi_report_lun_scan() or the VPD handling code.

So again, I don't think it's something we need to worry about.

Cheers,

Hannes
