OK, that's what I assumed.

Sounds like a dead controller to me.

I suggested just transitioning the state to DEAD... Not sure how keep-alives
behave though...

stopped is different because it is not used to determine if it is capable
for IO (admin or io queues). Hence it is ok to be a flag.

I'm just trying to understand if it falls into one of the existing 
states that
we have today. Because it sounds awfully like DEAD to me.
