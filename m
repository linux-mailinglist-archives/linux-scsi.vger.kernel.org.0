Thanks. For us, the current behavior after the fix I mentioned which =
broke things leaves us in a bad state. The only thing we can do is use =
no_path_retry in multipath.conf, but that brings with it just a new set =
of problems. There are times we do want an I/O error to return to the =
caller as quickly as possible (We actual don=E2=80=99t have any paths =
that can serve I/O). The state where one controller is unavailable and =
the other is transitioning is not a condition where we would want an I/O =
error returned. We expect that the transitioning path would protect us =
until it transitions to an online state in our case. These transition =
times in our case are very short, just a few seconds, but we would =
prefer to not hold on to I/O on the target if we can=E2=80=99t serve it. =
The transitioning state had been working great for this up until Centos =
8 stream picked up the change.

Thanks,
Brian
