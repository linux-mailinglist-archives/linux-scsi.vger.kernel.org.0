To be honest, it is just two days ago I have to take a close look
at your patchset because we may have to backport your patches for
addressing one RH report with high priority.

David is in CC list, and Laurence/David is looking the report too.

The thing is that 5 ~ 8 can fix the issue in a simpler way without
adding extra cost in fast path, and the idea is easier to be proved.

BTW, as a downstream kernel developer, I really hope all fix are simple and
easy to backport. More importantly, I do prefer to approaches in patch which
can be proved/verified easily, so further regression can be avoided.

I am not sure you can, because some iteration is done in atomic context.
