Not sure if that'd be easily possible.

Most drivers operate under the assumption that upon return from
eh_device_reset_handler() all commands for that device (except for the 
reset command itself and the command inducing the reset) will have to be 
aborted or completed.
As the call is synchronous, the LLDDs have to _wait_ for completion to 
happen (which, incidentally, is the cause for most of the issues we're 
having with SCSI EH...), and only then can they return from the callback.

So I can't see how we could delegate this to SCSI EH, as this would mean 
a break with the current behaviour.

Mind you, I would _love_ to be able to do an asynchronous device reset, 
seeing that we had _really_ good experience with the asynchronous 
command abort, but that will be an incompatible change.

Cheers,

Hannes
