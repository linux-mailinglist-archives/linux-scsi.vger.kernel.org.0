On second thought, I will take your suggestion to use 
lock_system_sleep()
and unlock_system_sleep() in error handler and remove the host_sem used
in suspend/resume, which can make the code more readable by keeping the
changes within error handler itself. However, please note that host_sem
will still be used to avoid concurrency of user access, error handler 
and
shutdown.

Can Guo.
