That is why we call HiSilicon SAS is SQ device, still from
blk-mq/scsi-mq viewpoint, :-)

Other non-SCSI drivers can benefit from that patchset too, such as NVMe.

Except for qla2xxx, there are also lpfc, virtio-scsi and smartpqi, and
there will be more since I heard that new version of one other popular
SCSI HBA will support real MQ.

I meant that way is the last straw, :-)
