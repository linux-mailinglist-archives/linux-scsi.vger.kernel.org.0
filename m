I gather that you look at a specific problem where second resolution is
sufficient. For upstream, the generic usefulness should be considered,
and I don't think we can say today that better-than-second resolution
will never be useful, so I still vote for milliseconds.

Wrt the enablement of the option on highly loaded systems, I'm not sure
I understand. You need to enable SCSI logging anyway, don't you? Is it
an issue to have to set 2 sysfs values rather than just one?

Martin
