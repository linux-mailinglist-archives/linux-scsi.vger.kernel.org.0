All true. My focus was to fix an issue that has been encountered=20
frequently by HPE. In the test scenario at hand, I expected to still
see some errors after applying this patch, but we didn't. Can we agree
to fix this issue now, and see later what else may need fixing?=20

I suppose that it's impossible to do error-proof probing in the
presence of random transport layer errors, so whatever we do will be
just a gradual improvement, improving matters in some scenarios while
possibly slowing down probing in others. Also, verifying changes in
this area with meaningful tests is difficult and a time and resource
consuming endeavour.

I think so. A frequent cause of errors in the multipath context is that
the udev rules assume that as soon as the "inquiry" sysfs attribute is
valid, the attributes "vpd_pg80" and "vpd_pg83" will be valid, too. But
in the presence of transport errors, any of the vpd attributes may be
invalid unless we retry.

Perhaps it also make sense to discuss the default timeouts? Given that
the max delay is (n_retries * timeout), the worst-case delay caused by
a single probing command would not change if we cut the timeout in half
and retry DID_TIME_OUT instead. In the case at hand, that would
probably have made sense - if the INQUIRY response wasn't received
after a few seconds, it wouldn't make sense to wait any longer. But I
guess there are other scenarios where a timeout of 20s or more is
required.

Note that the kernel isn't the only point of failure. udev rules
calling sg_inq or other similar tools may fall into the same trap. It
is even worse there, because commands called from udev rules are
expected to terminate quickly, thus there isn't much room for retries.
sg_inq uses a default passthrough timeout of 60s, and no retries.

We can't distinguish these two cases. I am not sure if we ever could,
but at least since da6269da4cfe2 ("block: remove
REQ_OP_SCSI_{IN,OUT}"), we obviously can't.

Martin K. P., Christoph, thoughts?
