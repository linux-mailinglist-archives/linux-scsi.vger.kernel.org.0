For a completely separate reason I would like to see PQ=3D1 expose the =
sd device.

ALUA state transitions from unavailable back to another state does not
work depending on what state devices are in when they are initially =
discovered.
In the ALUA unavailable state the peripheral qualifier of the device =
should also
be set to 001b.

If the device is not in the unavailable state when it is initially =
discovered
(PQ not 001b), it can move to and from the unavailable state with the =
expected
result like this:

/dev/sg1  7 0 1 1  0  /dev/sdb  PURE      FlashArray        8888

root@init106-1 class]# sg_inq /dev/sdb
standard INQUIRY: [qualifier indicates no connected LU]
PQual=3D1  Device_type=3D0  RMB=3D0  version=3D0x06  [SPC-4]
[AERC=3D0]  [TrmTsk=3D0]  NormACA=3D1  HiSUP=3D1  Resp_data_format=3D2

EncServ=3D0  MultiP=3D1 (VS=3D0)  [MChngr=3D0]  [ACKREQQ=3D0]  Addr16=3D0
RelAdr=3D0]  WBus16=3D0  Sync=3D0  Linked=3D0  [TranDis=3D0]  CmdQue=3D1
[SPI: Clocking=3D0x0  QAS=3D0  IUS=3D0]
length=3D96 (0x60)   Peripheral device type: disk
Vendor identification: PURE
Product identification: FlashArray
Product revision level: 8888
Unit serial number: 1D6DB146171D4E32000113E6

If, however, the device is already in this state when it is initially
discovered, no sd device is created like this:

/dev/sg2  7 0 1 1  0  PURE      FlashArray        8888

Since no sd device is ever created, when the ALUA state changes and the
peripheral qualifier is set back to 0, manual intervention is required.
The devices peripheral qualifier is correct after another rescan,
but no sd device is created.

[root@init106-1 ~]# sg_inq /dev/sg2
standard INQUIRY:
PQual=3D0  Device_type=3D0  RMB=3D0  version=3D0x06  [SPC-4]
[AERC=3D0]  [TrmTsk=3D0]  NormACA=3D1  HiSUP=3D1  Resp_data_format=3D2
SCCS=3D1  ACC=3D0  TPGS=3D1  3PC=3D1  Protect=3D0  [BQue=3D0]
EncServ=3D0  MultiP=3D1 (VS=3D0)  [MChngr=3D0]  [ACKREQQ=3D0]  Addr16=3D0
[RelAdr=3D0]  WBus16=3D0  Sync=3D0  Linked=3D0  [TranDis=3D0]  CmdQue=3D1
[SPI: Clocking=3D0x0  QAS=3D0  IUS=3D0]
length=3D96 (0x60)   Peripheral device type: disk
Vendor identification: PURE
Product identification: FlashArray
Product revision level: 8888
Unit serial number: 1D6DB146171D4E32000113E6

The existing device must first be removed for another initial
rediscovery to correct the issue.

This hole makes the unavailable ALUA state unattractive. Allowing
the peripheral qualifier set to 001b to still create an sd device
on discovery corrects this hole.

Thanks,
Brian
