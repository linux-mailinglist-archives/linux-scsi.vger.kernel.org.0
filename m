Greetings Beloved,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as big surprise. Actually, I came
across your E-mail from my personal search afterward I decided to
email you directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my
final wish before I die.

Meanwhile, I am Madam Elisabeth Edwards, 73 years, from USA, childless
and I am suffering from a long-time cancer and from all indication my
condition is really deteriorating as my doctors have confirmed and
courageously advised me that I may not live beyond two months from now
for the reason that my tumor has reached a critical stage which has
defiled all forms of medical treatment.

Since my days are numbered, I=E2=80=99ve decided willingly to fulfill my lo=
ng-
time promise to donate the sum of Ten Million One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($10,100,000) remaining in my foreign bank account over 9
years due to my health problem. This fund was obtained by me when I
was dealing on Gold.

My promise is to help the widows, handicapped, orphans,
underprivileged, to build technical school and hospital for their
well-being. If you will be obedient to assist me fulfill my promise as
 I said here kindly show me your first obedience by providing me your
personal details your last name and first name, your exact address and
 your mobile/house/office telephone contact, and an identification
such  as driver's license or international passport data page so I can
forward them to my bank and have you present to the bank as the next
person in charge of this fund, to enable me introduce you to my bank
management as the sole beneficiary and to enable them check whether it
 will be possible to transfer or deliver my fund to you so that if I
die anytime, the situation will not be complicated.

I have been trying to handle this project for the past 4 years by
myself when I will get better, but I have seen that it won=E2=80=99t be
possible anymore.

Please get back to me if you can handle the project for more details
and explanations email me at Id:  elisabeth1981@mail.com


God bless you

Elisabeth Edwards
