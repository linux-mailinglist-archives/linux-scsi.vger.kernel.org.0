But then I'll have to use xa_find() to get to the actual element as the 
1:1 mapping between SCSI LUN and array index is lost.
And seeing that most storage arrays will expose only up to 256 LUNs I 
thought this was a good improvement on lookup.
Of course, this only makes sense if xa_load() is more efficient than 
xa_find(). If not then of course it's a bit futile.
