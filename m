Yeah, it does seem like perhaps a BFQ fix like this would be ideal.

Ah, right.  Sorry.  As per the cover letter, I've tested against the
Chrome OS 5.4 tree and also against mainline Linux and both
experienced the same behavior.  It's slightly more convenient for me
to test against the Chrome OS 5.4 tree, so I've been focusing most of
my effort there.

As mentioned in the cover letter, in the Chrome OS 5.4 branch we have
an extra FROMLIST patch from Salman, specifically:

http://lore.kernel.org/r/20200207190416.99928-1-sqazi@google.com

...that's what makes the return value "bool" for me.
