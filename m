SCSI EH is designed to start handling until all in-flight commands are
failed, so it waits until all requests are failed first.

It is actually O(n) because each hardware queue handles request
in parallel.

It is degraded to O(n^2) or O(n * m) just because of shared host lock.

Single or N scsi_host_busy() won't take too long without host lock, what
matters is actually the per-host lock spin time which can be accumulated
as too big.
