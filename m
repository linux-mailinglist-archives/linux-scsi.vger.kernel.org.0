I agree, deeply weird :)

I agree.

I agree.

The logic in commit '50b812755e97' puzzled me a lot.
I wonder why the 128 magic number in the for loop.

My understanding is:
    - try to allocate things at start-up
    - check if this allocation crosses the 4G limit (see commit log)
    - keep the "unusable" allocation allocated, so that this memory is 
reserved (i.e. wasted) and won't be allocated later (see usage of the 
dif_bundl_pool dma pool in [1])
    - hope that tying 128 allocations is enough and that no "unusable 
allocation" will be done at run-time.

In other words, I tried to convinced myself that there was a real logic, 
even if unperfect.


Even if the above description is correct and if it works as expected in 
RL, it real looks like an overkill!


Now that I reread code around 'dif_local_dma_alloc' usage, I'm tempt to 
agree with your feeling about debug code.
