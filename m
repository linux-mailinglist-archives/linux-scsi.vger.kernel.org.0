We have a reproducible test case, so testing the patch was
not a problem.  I agree the log message should be restricted
or suppressed though, once would be enough.

The problem appeared to be that an extra bit was set (because
the length was too long by 16K) and our testing worked OK with
the ersp_iu data truncated to the correct structure size.
