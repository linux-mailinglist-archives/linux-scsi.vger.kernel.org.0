Hi Bart,

We've studied BSG and in general it can work.

The following is our draft design, please give your comments:
1. Applications from user space send commands to driver thru struct
sg_io_v4, the private data(used by driver) is saved in sg_io_v4->request
and the data length is saved in sg_io_v4->request_len.

2. SG_IO is used in bsg_ioctl(), the following has to be set because
bsg_transport_check_proto() will check the fields:
    sg_io_v4->protocol = BSG_PROTOCOL_SCSI;
    sg_io_v4->subprotocol = BSG_SUB_PROTOCOL_SCSI_TRANSPORT;

Does the above match the BSG design?

And one question:
The number of queue and queue depth are hardcoded in bsg_setup_queue().
       set->nr_hw_queues = 1;
       set->queue_depth = 128;

Any reason to do it? how about it does not match the chip's capability?
for example, the chip supports 8 hardware queues and each queue depth
is 4096?
