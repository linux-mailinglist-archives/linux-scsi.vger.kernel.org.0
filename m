Note that Boojin Kim, who has been Cc'ed on all these patches, has already been
working on replacing Samsung's legacy inline encryption implementation with one
using the new framework.

Unfortunately, Samsung's UFS inline encryption hardware doesn't follow the UFS
specification, so it needs custom driver code and doesn't take much advantage of
ufshcd-crypto (this patchset).  However, it can still use the blk-crypto
framework.  So only the driver needs to differ, not the rest of the storage
stack.  This differs from the "old world" where every vendor had to customize
the entire storage stack to support their inline encryption hardware.

Anyway, ufshcd-crypto (this patchset) is still needed for all vendors who did
mostly/fully follow the UFS specification, e.g. Mediatek
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20200304022101.14165-1-stanley.chu@mediatek.com)
and Qualcomm
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20200621173713.132879-1-ebiggers@kernel.org).

More reviews are always appreciated, though note that this patchset has already
been out for review for over a year.  (This is really v15; Satya started the
numbering over after blk-crypto was merged in v5.8-rc1.)  So I'm not sure we
should count on many more formal reviews.
