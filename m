The above description is incomplete: what is missing is an explanation 
of how the L2P data is made persistent and also how it is stored on the 
device. Is an L2P update written to the device every time data on the 
device is modified or only during an orderly shutdown? In the former 
case, how big is the impact on write performance? In the latter case, 
does that mean that data is lost during an unorderly shutdown? Is HPB a 
feature that perhaps only works well for battery-powered devices?

Is the persistent L2P data overwritten in place or is new data appended 
as an update after existing data? In the former case, is all L2P data 
lost in case of a power failure? In the latter case, how is it 
guaranteed that enough free space is available to make the L2P data 
persistent?

What are the similarities and differences compared to the lightnvm 
framework that was added several years ago to the Linux kernel? Which of 
the code in this patch can be shared with the lightnvm framework?

Can this parameter be changed from a compile-time option into something 
that is configurable at runtime, e.g. a sysfs or configfs attribute?

Isn't maintaining a LUN to scsi_device mapping something that is already 
done by the SCSI core? See also __scsi_device_lookup().

Please introduce helper functions such that no #if 
defined(CONFIG_SCSI_UFSHPB) statements are required in .c files. From 
Documentation/process/4.Coding.rst: "As a general rule, #ifdef use
should be confined to header files whenever possible."

The above change should be moved into the combination of patches 1/5 and 
3/5, and the changes below probably too.

Please remove the above 24 macro definitions and use get_unaligned_*() / 
put_unaligned_*() instead.

Thanks,

Bart.
