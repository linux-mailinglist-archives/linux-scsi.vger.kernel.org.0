Subject: [PATCH V7 0/3] Minor fixes to UFS error handling
Date:   Wed,  2 Dec 2020 04:04:00 -0800
Message-Id: <1606910644-21185-1-git-send-email-cang@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-scsi.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org

This series mainly fixes below two things which come along with UFS error
handling in some corner cases.
[1] Concurrency problems btw err_handler and paths like system suspend/resume/shutdown and async scan.
[2] Race condition btw UFS error recovery and task abort which happens to W-LU during suspend/resume/shutdown.

The 1st change is tested with error/fault injections to power mode change
operations during system PM operations and async scan. The 2nd change is
tested by mimicing SSU cmd timeout during suspend/resume/shutdown. The 3rd
one is just a minor change to a check condition in IRQ handler such that
the driver can dump host regs when AH8 error happens.

Change since v6:
- Updated the check condition of updating clk_scaling.active_reqs in __ufshcd_transfer_req_compl()

Change since v5:
- Incorporated Stanley's comment

Change since v4:
- Fixed a typo found by Stanley.

Change since v3:
- Slightly updated some commit msg lines, no code changes.

Change since v2:
- Added one more minor change into this series.

Change since v1:
- Removed Change-Id from commit msg

  scsi: ufs: Serialize eh_work with system PM events and async scan
  scsi: ufs: Fix a race condition between ufshcd_abort and eh_work
  scsi: ufs: Print host regs in IRQ handler when AH8 error happens
