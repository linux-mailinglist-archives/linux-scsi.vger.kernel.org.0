Why does in_interrupt() matter here?  And is this even set if you have
threaded interrupts?

This feels very wrong as you are doing something different if this is
called depending on the context and you really do not have control over
the context of when this is called at all.

What problem is this solving?  How is a host controller driver being
unloaded before the children it controls are removed?  Who is holding a
reference on them and why is this happening only now?

And who cares about unloading the kernel module in this fashion?

thanks,
