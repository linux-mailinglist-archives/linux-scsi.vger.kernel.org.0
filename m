I don't believe we ever do.  We've arranged pretty much everything so
the SCSI device is immediately obtainable from the enclosing structure
(sysfs, rw, ioctl, interrupt from device etc).  The only time we do a
direct lookup by H:C:T:L is the very old scsi proc API, which we're
trying to deprecate.
