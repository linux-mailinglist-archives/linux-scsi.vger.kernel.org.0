Forget to mention, the in-tree code has been this shape for long
time, please see sbitmap_resize() called from blk_mq_map_swqueue().

Another update is that V4 of 'scsi: core: only re-run queue in scsi_end_request()
if device queue is busy' is quite hard to implement since commit b4fd63f42647110c9
("Revert "scsi: core: run queue if SCSI device queue isn't ready and queue is idle").
