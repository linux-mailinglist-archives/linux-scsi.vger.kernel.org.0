That's not really the point; this function is the first stage of error 
recovery. And the only real way of exercising this is to inject a 
command timeout, which is nearly impossible without dedicated hardware.
So this function will have a very limited exposure, but nevertheless a 
quite crucial function.
Hence I'm not quite agree with your reasoning, and rather would have it 
fixed.
But as we're having an alternative fix now, it might be best if you 
could drop it from your patchset and we'll fix it separately.

Cheers,

Hannes
