Looks the current driver wires nr_irq_queues with nr_poll_queues, which is
wrong logically.

Here:

1) hisi_hba->queue_count means the max supported queue count(irq queues
+ poll queues)

2) max vectors(32) means the max supported irq queues, but actual
nr_irq_queues can be less than allocated vectors because of the irq
allocation bug

3) so the max supported poll queues should be (hisi_hba->queue_count -
nr_irq_queues).

What I meant is that nr_poll_queues shouldn't be related with allocated
msi vectors.

It should be that cq_nvecs vectors spread over all CPUs, and
iopoll_q_cnt are spread over all CPUs too.

For each queue type, nr_queues of this type are spread over all
CPUs.

That isn't true, please see my above comment.
