It might be reasonable to just include the hardware-wrapped key support whenever
QTI_ICE_COMMON is enabled.  Note that I'm not planning separate kconfig options
at the block or fscrypt levels.

If we do have this kconfig option, then please make sure that the help text
properly explains it.  That should include linking to the documentation where
the reader can find out more about what this feature is, and hence why they
might want to enable it, or not enable it.

Also this code probably should be part of the qti-ice-common module (which maybe
should be called "qti-ice-lib"?) rather than its own module.  That would mean
making QTI_HW_WRAPPED_KEYS a bool option that controls whether qti-ice-hwkm.c is
built into qti-ice-common, rather than a tristate that controls whether it's
built into its own module.
