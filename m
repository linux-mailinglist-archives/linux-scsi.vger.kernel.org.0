Hi Hannes

Indeed I use scsi as the example because for these Enterprise
Production environments, that is the single biggest consumer of the
messaging.
That and the alua messages.

We have two issues.
1. systems stopping in emergency mode because LVM times out during all
the discovery, and in cases device-mapper-multipath devices also not
coming ready.

2. Hard lockups due to both the serial and VGA slow consolw code where
the logging and discovery is writing to console. has a lock and then
the lock ownership access exceeds the watchdog_thresh 

If we could prevent the logging until all the switchroot stuff happens
and the systems have scanned and onlined the LVM and device-mapper
stuff etc., then changing the priority may work. 

The problem only delaying the output is that it wont solve the hard
lockup due to the console code slowing down tasks writing to it so they
exceeds the 10s default for watchdog_thresh. I had to use 30 or 60 in
certain cases even with a VGA console and still hit the hard lockup.
Using modprpbe after boot the systems are up  one at a time for say
qla2xxx and lpfc we seem to handle the logging without triggering the
watchdog.

Of course the question then becomes what are we missing for debugging
with the silence. In the patch I showed as an example, I was selective
about what I left out but I do log the disk being attached for example.

Its a tough problem to solve. The console code is not going to be fixed
to make it scale better for some time, although I know folks are
working on it.

I sent a patch some time back that we use quite often now to increase
the watchdog_thresh on the kernel line but my DL980 and these other
Giant HPE Superdomes etc. still see hardlockups not only during boot
but sometimes just in error recovery when rports leave and a giant log
storm happens when they recover.

I just figured what I am doing is the lowest risk and could be re-
enabled once up witha simple echo command so we dont miss anything
after boot.

I will think about this some more 
I do appreciate the comments and discussion.

Regards
Laurence
