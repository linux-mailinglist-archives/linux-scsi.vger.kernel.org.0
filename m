It is difficult to test this type of event w/out a multi-initiator =

Yes, this applies to all Unit Attentions. I just mentioned the ones st =

I would rather say that midlevel provides a method for all ULDs to see =
if certain
Unit Attentions have happened. One gets all the sense data, but others =
can
at least see that something has happened.

My text seems to be somewhat ambiguous. I meant that there would be two
counters, one for New Media events and one for PORs. St needs to know
which one (or both) has occurred.

Yes, this is what has motivated the suggestions above. SCSI does send =
Unit
Attentions to all initiators. Linux could extend this so that all ULDs =
attached to
a device get the Unit Attentions. However, one big problem is, where to =
find
someone to implement this?
