This is a lot of changes and it still does not address the issues on
the bugzilla bug report. For starts a loop on modprobe and rmmod fails.

We need udevadm settle (when availble) in between loads, and then the
removal simply needs to be patient. I'll be posting patches to fstests
which demonstrates this quite clearly.

I believe that... this is the way.
