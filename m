Bart,
You might add these:
   - sane deletion semantics
   - inbuilt locking
   - inherently safer iterations, especially if marks are used

Matthew can probably add more.

The way that the SCSI object tree hangs together with doubly linked
lists may have been a coherent design 20 years ago when JB wrote it,
but it has been white-anted big time since then.

The current state of that code is hard to defend. I have between 10 and 20
more examples of patently stupid things the current code does. See my
exchange with JB concerning the starget iterator over its sdevs that decided
to check on _every_ sdev in that host. That is done in several places.

The redundant sdevs in a shost collection is probably the most glaring
current design flaw.

I don't believe that overall memory usage is a problem. Fitting the sdev_s
of hot devices in a smaller number of cache lines would help. That is
where Ming Lei was looking that kicked off this exercise that has
morphed into using xarray.
