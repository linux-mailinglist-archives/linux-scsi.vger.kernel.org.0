Wrt. dispatching requests from hctx->dispatch, there is really one
race given scsi's run queue from scsi_end_request() may not see
that request. Looks that is what the patch 1 is addressing.

However, for this issue, there isn't race, given when we get budget,
the request isn't dequeued from BFQ yet. If budget is assigned
successfully, either the request is dispatched to LLD successfully,
or STS_RESOURCE is triggered, or running out of driver tag, run queue
is guaranteed to be started for handling another dispatch path 
which running out of budget.

That is why I raise the question why BFQ dispatches request in this way.

Correctness doesn't have to cause performance regression, does it?

As I mentioned, if BFQ doesn't dispatch request in this special way,
there isn't such race.
