The binding doesn't allow the 8183 as a fallback for the 8195, so that
tracks ;)

Really the problem is that the commit subject says that this is adding
8196, but that's not what the body of the commit actually is. I know you
mention splitting further down the mail, but what I'd really like to see
done is one commit that corrects the property situation for the 8195,
providing whatever justifications you have for the changes - it's okay
if you don't necessarily have explanations for backed by stuff from docs
or whatever, if all you have is based on what platforms with the 8195 are
doing just mention that as why you need to have x-supply or whatever.
Then add one commit that adds the 8196, which is probably a fairly
minimal change once the 8195 is corrected.

Right. I'd accept freq-table-hz if the other devices here have been
using it all along, but if this is something new - then please use the
operating-points-v2 property. Looking at the binding example, it looks
like it does indeed use freq-table-hz, so that's probably justification
enough to keep doing so.

As I said above, if you don't have some documented justification, just
cite usage or w/e, that's better than not mentioning it at all. If you
don't work for the vendor (and sometimes, sadly, when you do) it's not
possible to get complete info.

My personal opinion is that the best way to do supplies is to match as
close to possible as the datasheet names for the supply. If that means
the supply names have to be different between devices, I think the
more complex binding is better than trying to get the names to somehow
fit for all devices.

I went and looked at the driver, and the list of clocks it looks up
don't even match what the binding permits for the 8195 (or any other
device):

	if (ufs_mtk_init_host_clk(hba, "crypt_mux",
				  &cfg->clk_crypt_mux))
		goto disable_caps;

	if (ufs_mtk_init_host_clk(hba, "crypt_lp",
				  &cfg->clk_crypt_lp))
		goto disable_caps;

	if (ufs_mtk_init_host_clk(hba, "crypt_perf",
				  &cfg->clk_crypt_perf))
		goto disable_caps;

+  - if:
+      properties:
+        compatible:
+          contains:
+            enum:
+              - mediatek,mt8195-ufshci
+    then:
+      properties:
+        clocks:
+          minItems: 8
+        clock-names:
+          items:
+            - const: ufs
+            - const: ufs_aes
+            - const: ufs_tick
+            - const: unipro_sysclk
+            - const: unipro_tick
+            - const: unipro_mp_bclk
+            - const: ufs_tx_symbol
+            - const: ufs_mem_sub

Looks like that series should never have actually been accepted,
particularly given some of the commentary on it. It's worth noting, that
there is no ack etc from a devicetree binding maintainer. Telling I
suppose.

You don't mention this mismatch in your commit message, but you should.

Also makes me wonder why the driver doesn't bother to enable all of
these clocks either, since the IP must need them for something, right?
Does the driver even work for 8195?

For fallbacks, mostly think of it as "if the driver probed thinking that
this was a 8195, would it work correctly"? If you have to make changes
to a driver written for a 8195 to support clocks that are required on a
8196, then the devices are not compatible. If the 8196 will function if
the extra clocks are not enabled, then sure have a fallback. But if you
need to turn them on, then the devices are not compatible.
In other words, if the fallback doesn't implement a viable subset of
features on the new device, then it's not suitable.

As for the 13 v 16 etc, sure order them last. You'll have to be careful
with how you set up the conditional portion of the binding so that it
doesn't create impossible constraints, if you decide that a fallback is
suitable. Obviously, if there's no fallback, cos the extra 3 clocks are
mandatory, then it'll be much easier to set the conditions up.
