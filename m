For ata devices, the parent -> child relationship is:

ata_host (the adapter) -> ata_port -> ata_link -> ata_device (HDD, SSD or ATAPI
CD/DVD)

For scsi devices representing ATA devices, it is:

ata_port -> scsi_host -> scsi_target -> scsi_device -> scsi_disk (or gendisk for
a CD/DVD)

When devices are scanned, libata will create ports and create a scsi_host for
each port, and a scsi device for each ata_device found on the link(s) for the
port. There is no direct relationship between an ata_device (the HDD or SSD) and
its scsi_device/scsi_disk (the device used to issue commands). The PM operations
we have are for ata_port and scsi_device. For the scsi device, the operations
are actually defined per device type, so in the scsi_disk driver (sd) for HDDs
and SSDs.

> But in any case, this approach seems like a layering violation.  Why not 

The layering violation is I think only with the direct reference to the scsi
device power.is_suspended field, which is definitely not pretty. But there are
some other drivers doing something similar:

$ git grep "power\.is_suspended" | grep -v drivers/base/power/main.c
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_display_power_well.c:	if
(!dev_priv->drm.dev->power.is_suspended)
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac-stm32.c:	if
(!dwmac->dev->power.is_suspended) {
drivers/platform/surface/surface_acpi_notify.c:	if (d->dev->power.is_suspended) {

All the other code (ata calling scsi) is normal per the SCSI-to-ata translation
needed (all ata devices are represented as scsi devices in Linux, following the
SAT=scsi ATA translation specifications).

Yes, ideally, that is what we should do. Such fix is however more involved, and
so I prefer not to push for this right now as a fix for the regression at hand.
But I will definitively look into this.

Yes. But again more fixes needed:
1) libata uses its error handling path to reset a port on resume and probe the
links again. The devices found are then revalidated (IDENTIFY command, reading
log pages etc). This call to EH is triggered in the pm->resume operation, but EH
runs as an asynchronous task. So the port->resume may complete before EH is
done. We need to change the EH call to be synchronous in ->resume
2) We need to remove triggering the task that does scsi_rescan_device() in EH
and move that trigger to scsi_device ->resume.
3) Modify scsi_device ->resume() to call scsi_rescan_device()

Safely doing (3) requires synchronization between ata_port->resume and
scsi_device->resume. We can do that by adding a device link between ata_device
and scsi_device. Doing so, the scsi device becomes the grandchild of the
ata_port and we are guaranteed that its ->resume will happen only once the ata
port ->resume is done.

That will also improve things as we will be able to rescan the scsi device (and
thus catch any change to the device) *before* the device ->resume operation
re-enables issuing user commands by un-quiescing the device request queue.

As you can see, that is all beyond a quick fix for a regression... Will work on
this.

Cheers.
