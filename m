blk_queue_may_bounce will be entered for the few drives that set
BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH because they can't handle highmem (which is a subset
of the non-ZONE_DMA memory).  The only driver that actually requires
ZONE_DMA based bouncing is ps3rom, and that driver does a manual
and ubconditional bounce buffering.

I've already sent out patches for all of drivers/scsi/ today, except
for the ps3rom bounce buffer alllocation which is fine but should
probably be changed to use the page allocator directly.

Yes.
