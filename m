It is a marginal saving, but for arrays this size it makes sense to not
have to populate the data into the stack before using it and then
discarding it. This change essentially replaces quite a lot of
instructions that put the data onto the stack so I think it's worth while.

Not sure how to respond to this. If they wonder why it is static const
and don't know why then one would hope they look it up in K&R and
familiarize themselves with C.  It's not so subtle.
