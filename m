Jeepers -- that global #pragma pack(1) is bollocks.

I think there are a couple of __u64 that are 32bit aligned.
Just marking those field __packed __aligned(4) should have
the desired effect.
Or use a typedef for '__u64 with 32bit alignment'.
(There probably ought to be one in types.h)

Then add compile-time asserts that any non-trivial structures
the hardware accesses are the right size.
