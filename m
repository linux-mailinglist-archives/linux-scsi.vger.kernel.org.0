I have tested relatively lower rates, like ~450K IOPS, without any 
noticeable regression.

I can test higher rates, like 2M IOPS, when I get access to the HW.

@Kashyap, Any chance you can help test performance here?

Sure, I don't think that minor performance improvements can justify the 
excessive memory.

Thanks,
