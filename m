OK, but this should work for all devices, just like the device cgroup
if it's going to be an adjunct to it.

Firstly, since it does part of what you want, we at least need to
understand why you think it can't be enhanced to do everything.

The /sys problem has been discussed many times.  GregKH really doesn't
like the idea of filtering /sys (and most container people agree), so
the options available seem to be don't mount /sys in a container or
emulate it via fuse.  If you pick either does the device cgroup now
work for you?

Christian Brauner is looking at this ... apparently Ubuntu has some
thumb drive inside lxc container use case that needs it.

Well, not necessarily, the pid namespace is an example of a remapping
namespace.  The same thing could be done for device numbering, but
there really needs to be a compelling case.  Given our use of hotplug,
why would any tool assume compact numbering?  And if you don't need
compact numbering there's no need to bother with remapping.

OK, so still, why not fix or enhance the device cgroup?  The current
proposal seems to want to duplicate it as a namespace.
