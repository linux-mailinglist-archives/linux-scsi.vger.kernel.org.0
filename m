Hi

There is an issue with the SCSI UFS driver when the optional
BOOT well-known LUN fails to probe, which is not a fatal error.
The issue is that the device and its "managed" device link do not
then get deleted.  The device because the device link has a
reference to it.  The device link because it can only be deleted
by device_del(), but device_add() was never called, so device_del()
never will be either.

Since V2, these patches fix the issue by amending device link removal to
accept removal of a link with an unregistered consumer device, as suggested
by Rafael.


Changes in V4:
    driver core: Prevent warning when removing a device link from unregistered consumer
	Add stable tag and Rafael's Reviewed-by

    driver core: Add ability to delete device links of unregistered devices
	Amend comment "discover an error" -> "discovering an error"
	Merge with next patch

    scsi: ufshcd: Fix device links when BOOT WLUN fails to probe
	Merge with previous patch
	Add Rafael's Reviewed-by


Changes in V3:

    driver core: Prevent warning when removing a device link from unregistered consumer
	New patch split from "driver core: Add ability to delete device
	links of unregistered devices" except first chunk from that patch
	dropped as unnecessary

    driver core: Add ability to delete device links of unregistered devices
	Move warning fix to separate patch.


Changes in V2:

    Take approach suggested by Rafael
