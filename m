God's Select

I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great
sorrow in my heart, My Name is Mrs Isabella Sayouba, I am from Tunisia
and I am contacting you from a Hospital in Burkina Faso, I want to
tell you this because I don't have any other option than to tell you
as I was touched to open up to you, I married to Mr. Sayouba Brown who
worked with Tunisia Ambassador in Burkina Faso for nine years before
he died in the year 2005. We were married for eleven years without a
child.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. Since
his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum of US$8.5m (Eight Million Five hundred Thousand
Dollars) in a bank in Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso in
west Africa Presently this money is still in the bank. He made this
money available for exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining.

Recently, my doctor told me that I would not last for the period of
seven months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is
my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to hand this
money over to you to take care of the less-privileged people, you will
utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you
to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use While 70%
of the money will go to charity" people in the street and helping the
orphanage. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my
family member, just to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.
Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and accept my soul in
the paradise because this illness has suffered me so much.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
bank in Burkina Faso and I will also instruct the Bank Manager to
issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present
beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you
will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

From Mrs. Isabella Sayouba.
