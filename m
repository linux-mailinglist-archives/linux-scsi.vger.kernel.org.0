To clarify: This problem is not seen in 845 with upstream kernel ie
5.5-rc1 but regression is observed in sm8150 and 8998 (Jeff)

And if I add the reset line to 845 (i am testing on dragon board
RB3, I am seeing same issue here as well)

Sure and this seems to do the trick on 845 with resets defined, Jeff can
you try this on your laptop

But I dont get same result on sm8150-mtp, i am still seeing timeout with
1000000us.

The bigger question is why is the reset causing the timeout to be
increased for sdm845 and not to work in case of sm8150!
