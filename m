When request is queued to lld via .queue_rq(), the request has been
removed from scheduler queue. And IO merge is just done inside or
against scheduler queue.

BLK_STS_RESOURCE or BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE or getting no budget can be
thought as device saturation feedback, then more requests can be
gathered in scheduler queue since we don't dequeue request from
scheduler queue when that happens, then IO merge is possible.

Without any device saturation feedback from driver, block layer just
dequeues request from scheduler queue with same speed of submission to
hardware, then no IO can be merged.

If you observe sequential IO on NVMe PCI, you will see no IO merge
basically.
