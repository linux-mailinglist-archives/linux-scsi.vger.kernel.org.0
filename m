OK, I see. I assumed that rq->mq_hctx was statically set when we 
initially allocate the static requests per hctx; but that doesn’t appear 
so - it's set in blk_mq_get_request()->blk_mq_rq_ctx_init().

Again, this was for the same reason being that I thought we could not 
differentiate which rqs were associated with which hctx.

Yeah, understood.

OK, fine.

So, to me, this approach also seems viable then.

I am however not so happy with how we use blk_mq_tag_set.tags[0] for the 
shared tags; I would like to use blk_mq_tag_set.shared_tags and make 
blk_mq_tag_set.tags[] point at blk_mq_tag_set.shared_tags or maybe not 
blk_mq_tag_set.tags[] at all. However maybe that change may be more 
intrusive.

And another more real concern is that we miss a check somewhere for 
rq->mq_hctx == hctx when examining the bits on the shared tags.

Thanks,
John
