Hi Hannes,


Thanks your detailed comments.

Right, currently it is always a command timeout which makes EH got 
engaged. The worse situation is that some IOs are failed with response 
while other IOs
are timeout. Then when the first IO with response complete, it tries to 
enter EH (just mark host SHOST_RECOVERY), then it begins to block IOs. 
Normally maybe
after almost 30s, all those IOs are completed (timeout or failed)，then 
it enters EH. So the blocking time of this situation is waiting for EH 
(max 30s) + EH (serval seconds ~ 10+seconds).

Ok, but what we see is that hard disk is more easily broken than HBA, 
and usually error handling is due to a bad disk though the other disks 
are normal.
Current SCSI EH is based on scsi host (there is a EH thread for every 
scsi host), I think if SCSI EH is based on scsi device (there is a EH 
thread for every scsi device),
when one IO of one disk is failed or timeout, we just mark the disk as 
RECOVERY and trigger EH of the disk. Only when recovery operation of the 
device also is failed, then
trigger EH of scsi host.  Maybe it can alleviate the issue.
Even if there is something wrong with HBA, once IO of a disk is fialed 
or timeout, it will also stop IOs of the disk immediately and 
separately, and i think maybe it doesn't make much difference.
(In current SCSI EH, i think it also the situation that many IOs are 
still sent to broken HBA, if previous IOs are all timeout).
