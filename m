Patches ??

And it is not just SES device implementations that were broken. The
relationship between Additional Element Status diagnostic page (dpage)
and the Enclosure Status dpage was under-specified in SES-2 and that
led to the EIIOE field being introduced during the SES-3 revisions.
And the meaning of EIIOE was tweaked several times *** before SES-3 was
standardized. Anyone interested in the adventures of EIIOE can see
the code of sg_ses.c in sg3_utils. The sg_ses utility is many times
more complex than anything else in the sg3_utils package.

And that complexity led me to suspect that the Linux SES driver was
broken. It should be 3 or 4 times larger than it is! It simply doesn't
do enough checking.

So yes Martin, you are on the right track.

BTW the NVME Management Interface folks have decided to use SES-3 for
NVME enclosure management rather than invent their own can of worms :-)

*** For example EIIOE started life as a 1 bit field, but two cases
     wasn't enough, so it became a 2 bit field and now uses all
     four possibilities.
