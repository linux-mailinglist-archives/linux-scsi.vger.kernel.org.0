In the ALUA transitioning state, we cannot process READ or WRITE and
will return with the sense data as you mentioned above. We expect
retries down that transitioning path until it transitions to another
ALUA state (at least for some reasonable period of time for the
transition). The spec defines the state as the transition between
target asymmetric states. The current implementation requires
coordination on the target not to return a state transition down all
paths at the same time or risk all paths being failed. Using the ALUA
transitioning state allows us to respond to initiator READ and WRITE
requests even if we can't serve them when our internal target state is
transitioning (secondary to primary). The alternative is to queue them
which presents a different set of problems.

In this case it would seem having all paths move to transitioning
would lead to all paths lost. It is possible to imagine
implementations where for a brief period of time all paths are in a
transitioning state. What would be the point of returning a transient
state if the result is a permanent failure?

My proposed patch would not fail the paths in the case of
BLK_STS_AGAIN. This seems to result in the requests being retried
until the path transitions to either a failed state, standby or
unavailable, or an online state.

I have tested using the no_path_retry and you are correct that it does
work around the issue that I am seeing. The problem with that is there
are times we want to convey all paths down to the initiator as quickly
as possible and doing this will delay that.
