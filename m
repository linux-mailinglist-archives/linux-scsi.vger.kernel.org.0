To quote https://bugzilla.kernel.org/createaccount.cgi:
"""
Note that your email address will never be displayed to logged out
users. Only registered users will be able to see it.
"""

Not sure since when it's there. Maybe it was added due to EU GDPR?
Konstantin should know. But for me that's enough to not CC people. I
even heard from one well known kernel developer that his company got a
GDPR complaint because he had mentioning the reporters name and email
address in a Reported-by: tag.

Side note: bugbot afaics can solve the initial problem (e.g. interact
with reporters in bugzilla by mail without exposing their email
address). But to use bugbot one *afaik* still has to reassign a ticket
to a specific product and component in bugzilla. Some subsystem
maintainers don't want that, as that issues then does not show up in the
usual queries.

Ciao, Thorsten
