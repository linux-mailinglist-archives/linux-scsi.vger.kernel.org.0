Well the kernel is all about abstracting differences not baking in
assumptions. However can I ask a bit more about this security model?

Is the secure enclave just a separate userspace process or is it in a
separate virtual machine? Is it accessible at all by the kernel running
the driver?

The fact that key id is passed down into the kernel doesn't have to
imply the kernel does the final cryptographic operation. In the ARM
world you could make a call to the secure world to do the operation for
you. I note the keyctl() interface already has support for going to
userspace to make queries of the keyring. Maybe what is really needed is
an abstraction for the kernel to delegate the MAC calculation to some other
trusted process that also understands the keyid.

In an off list conversation it was suggested that maybe the PROGRAM_KEY
ioctl should be disabled for locked down kernels to dissuade production
use of the facility (it is handy for testing though!).

OK - I'll see what the others say.
