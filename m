I was referring to the claim in patch 00/32, i.e. that interrupt handlers 
only run when irqs are disabled.

It's true that IRQF_DISABLED could be used to avoid the need for irq locks 
in interrupt handlers. So, if you want to remove irq locks from interrupt 
handlers, today you can't use IRQF_DISABLED to help you. So what?

Prioritized interrupts are beneficial. Why would you want to avoid them?

Moreover, there's no reason to believe that m68k is the only platform that 
supports nested interrupts.
