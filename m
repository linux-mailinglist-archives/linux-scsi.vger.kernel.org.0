I=E2=80=99m not sure what you mean here. Are you saying both CMD1=E2=80=99=
s se_cmd and the ABORT=E2=80=99s se_cmd will have the CMD_T_ABORTED bit =
set and will both go through the aborted_task callout?

If you have a SCSI READ/WRITE se_cmd (CMD1 in my example) and a ABORT =
se_cmd (ABORT TMF in my example) on the conn_cmd_list, then the =
ABORT=E2=80=99s se_cmd would not have the CMD_T_ABORTED bit set, right? =
If so, what sets it?

If the SCSI R/W has the CMD_T_ABORTED bit set, we move it it back to the =
conn_cmd_list and the abort code path cleans it up. But then we still =
have the ABORT=E2=80=99s se_cmd on the tmp_list. We will then call=20

transport_generic_free_cmd(wait_for_tasks=3Dtrue) -> =
__transport_wait_for_tasks(fabric_stop=3Dtrue)

And wait for the ABORT to complete, and the ABORT does not complete =
until the last ref on the command it=E2=80=99s aborting completes.

If you have a LUN RESET in the mix like:

[CMD1 -> ABORT TMF -> LUN RESET TMF]

Then CMD1 and the ABORT could have their CMD_T_ABORTED bit set. =
core_tmr_drain_tmr_list would call __target_check_io_state during the =
RESET processing. However, in this case, the LUN RESET=E2=80=99s se_cmd =
would not have the bit set, so we would end up waiting like I described =
for that to complete. In that case though the RESET waits for the cmds =
and tmfs it is cleaning up.=
