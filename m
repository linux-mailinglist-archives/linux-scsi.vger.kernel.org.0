Ah ok, I think I confused it with the already existing
`/sys/class/fc_host`/`/sys/class/fc_transport/`/..., but thats something
different. Yeah, having some common ancestor makes sense, if the HBA
offers multiple ULPs.

Well, I mean, right now I don't have a immediate need for zfcp in this
regard, so I don't want to blow this out of proportions. But like I
said, we (zfcp) don't have a NVMe personality, so we never hook into
NVMe-FC.

Feel free to reach out, if there is anything coming up.
