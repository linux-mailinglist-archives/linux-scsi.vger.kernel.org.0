Some comments in this driver don't comply with the preferred multi-line
comment style, as reported by 'scripts/checkpatch.pl':

WARNING: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
WARNING: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

Fix those comments, along with the (unreported for some reason?) starts
of the multi-line comments not being /* on their own line...
