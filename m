The sg_io_v4 interface was specifically designed to _decouple_ the
user visible API from the kernel's 4-bytes-in-1-int representation.
So there are 4 levels of error reporting supported:
    1) from the kernel front-end: yield an errno
    2) from the driver (LLD): set driver_status
    3) from the transport: set transport status
    4) from the device (target or LU): set device_status

Those distinctions aren't that strict, there is some overlap (e.g.
timeouts). The sg version 3 interface (struct sg_io_hdr) is similar
but the names are less generic.

Can't remember if anyone every complained to me about not having
access to the message byte from SPI.
