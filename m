Its true that it shouldn't be any faster, but what irqpoll already has
and we don't need to reinvent is a proper budgeting mechanism that
needs to occur when multiple devices map irq vectors to the same cpu
core.

irqpoll already maintains a percpu list and dispatch the ->poll with
a budget that the backend enforces and irqpoll multiplexes between them.
Having this mechanism in irq (hard or threaded) context sounds
unnecessary a bit.

It seems like we're attempting to stay in irq context for as long as we
can instead of scheduling to softirq/thread context if we have more than
a minimal amount of work to do. Without at least understanding why
softirq/thread degrades us so much this code seems like the wrong
approach to me. Interrupt context will always be faster, but it is
not a sufficient reason to spend as much time as possible there, is it?

We should also keep in mind, that the networking stack has been doing
this for years, I would try to understand why this cannot work for nvme
before dismissing.

Oh, I didn't see that one, wonder why... thanks!

5% improvement, I guess we can buy that for other users as is :)

If we suffer from lots of context switches while the CPU is flooded with
interrupts, then I would argue that we're re-raising softirq too much.
In this use-case, my assumption is that the cpu cannot keep up with the
interrupts and not that it doesn't reap enough (we also reap the first
batch in interrupt context...)

Perhaps making irqpoll continue until it must resched would improve
things further? Although this is a latency vs. efficiency tradeoff,
looks like MAX_SOFTIRQ_TIME is set to 2ms:

"
  * The MAX_SOFTIRQ_TIME provides a nice upper bound in most cases, but in
  * certain cases, such as stop_machine(), jiffies may cease to
  * increment and so we need the MAX_SOFTIRQ_RESTART limit as
  * well to make sure we eventually return from this method.
  *
  * These limits have been established via experimentation.
  * The two things to balance is latency against fairness -
  * we want to handle softirqs as soon as possible, but they
  * should not be able to lock up the box.
"

Long, does this patch make any difference?
