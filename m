Well, _actually_ it's not just the SCSI drivers; it's just that the scsi 
driver exhibits these issues nicely.

The hope I had was that we can resolve this issue by making printk 
asynchrounous, such that each call to printk() wouldn't block.

The really should give us most what we want; the only issue is what to 
do with those messages which are spooled (but not printed).
For graphical UI this probably doesn't matter as the user will end up 
with a graphical interface sooner or later.

For text console things become tricky; we will need the console to get 
our prompt, but it might still be busy printing out stuff.

Can't we have a 'low priority' output of these messages, and stop 
printing them to the console once 'getty' starts?

Thing is, once 'getty' is up and running the user _can_ log in, so he 
can any debugging he likes from the system console; there the message 
log on the console is less important as the user can get the system log 
via other means.
It only gets important once getty is _not_ up, but then it's less time 
critical as there's nothing the user _can_ do.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Hannes
