You can only iterate over all tags with blk_mq_tag_to_rq() if requests 
are identified with tags, ie if there is a 1:1 mapping between tags and 
internal commands.
Quite some drivers have their internal housekeeping (like hpsa), or do 
not track all commands via tags (eg fnic or csiostor).
For those the block layer iterator will not work as designed.

I'm currently preparing a patchset to clean that up (cf my patchset 
'reserved tags for SCSI'), but that will probably take some time until 
it'll be accepted.

And even then some drivers have to rely on scsi_host_find_tag() in eg 
TMF completions to figure out if the command for which the TMF was sent
is still active.

But we can move the check into the drivers if you are worried about 
performance impacts; it's a bit lame if you ask me, but if that's the 
way it should be handled, fine by me.

Cheers,

Hannes
