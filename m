Coming back to this previous dmesg output as I am in fact seeing something very
similar now. See below.

suspend start and freezes the user tasks, as expected.

All devices are suspended. No issues. Then resume starts...

started bringing back up devices, but suspend comes back again.

which freezes the tasks, again.

And suspend finishes, followed by resume starting.

Resume restarted the devices, but there is no "Restarting tasks" ! So the user
tasks are frozen, hence the "hang". There are no user processes to run, so no
coming back to the shell.

So even without the libata patches fixing the resume mess, this issue does not
look like a libata issue. I think your bisect hitting the no_start_on_resume
patch is simply because that patch changes the timing of things and makes it
easier to hit this issue.

Adding PM folks because I am out of my depth on this one...

PM folks,

Rodrigo hit an issue doing suspend+resume cycles in a loop, with the resume
triggered a very short time (wakealarm) after starting resume. This ends up
with a hang. I could recreate the same in qemu. I cannot get wakealarm to work
for some reason, but I have a virtio device not supporting suspend which
triggers the resume in the middle of suspend. And repeating "systemctl suspend"
again and again, I end up with a similar hang:

[   98.455929] PM: suspend entry (s2idle)

[   98.479199] Freezing remaining freezable tasks
[   98.481887] Freezing remaining freezable tasks completed (elapsed 0.001 seconds)

suspend starts, freezineg the tasks.

[   98.507762] virtio-pci 0000:00:05.0: PM: failed to suspend async: error -95

Failure of the virtio device suspend which will trigger pm_recover+resume.

[   98.512917] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Synchronizing SCSI cache

Here, the scsi devices already suspended (asynchronously) do their thing.

[   98.521098] virtio_blk virtio3: 4/0/0 default/read/poll queues
[   98.548229] OOM killer enabled.

The tasks are restarted due to the suspend error above.

[   98.551734] random: crng reseeded on system resumption
[   98.559697] PM: suspend exit
[   98.561038] PM: suspend entry (s2idle)

[   98.580341] Freezing remaining freezable tasks
[   98.583109] Freezing remaining freezable tasks completed (elapsed 0.001 seconds)

but here, for whatever reason, the tasks are suspended again despite the fact
that we should be resuming. After this, I only see the scsi&ata devices
finishing suspend and then being resumed all normally. But no coming back to
the shell. It is frozen...

Any idea ?
