That is the part I didn't like or I thought could have issues:

1. What if we go back into marginal after the add() but before we have done scsi_eh_flush_done_q? You need the original looping code and some code for del() right?

2. My issue with #1 is why do we want to add code that loops over commands when we only care about the port state and when scsi_eh_flush_done_q and the abort completion code is already looping over them.

3. This is probably a matter of preference, and I can see why people would not like an extra callout. However, I like the idea that we have an eh callout for the transport class that checks if it's even worth it to run the eh code based on the port state and then we have a eh completion callout that can also check the port state and determine if it's ok.

If we had a marginal scsi_device state or even a bit then you would not actually need #3. The fc class could just set the device state/bit and we could check that in the eh completion code paths.
