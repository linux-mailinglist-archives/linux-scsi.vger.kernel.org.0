Well, yeah, maybe.
My aim here is that _all_ I/O requiring a tag from the hardware will be 
tracked by the blocklayer tagset. Only that will give the block-layer 
accurate information about outstanding commands, such that the ongoing 
CPU hotplug discussion can make the correct decisions and implement 
functions really covering all outstanding I/O.
It also allows us to use the scsi_host_busy_iter() functions within the 
driver, and will get rid of the hand-crafted iterations the driver has 
to do now.

It worked reasonably well, until I encountered the infamous AEN 
commands, which actually require the opposite: _not_ to be tracked by 
the block layer at all, as the commands themselves are just placeholders
to be returned by the firmware once an event occurs.
(And yes, I _do_ think this is a quite dangerous operation, because I 
can't quite see how one could reliably return this command in case of a 
firmware crash ...)
(But anyhow, that's how the firmware is written and we have to live with 
it.)

So I implemented this approach, to have tags which are ignored by the 
block layer. But I have to admit that this approach relies on quite some 
assumptions (like these tags are never actually submitted to the 
blocklayer itself, are never started etc), none of which are spelled out 
clearly (yet).
An alternative approach would be to arbitrary decrease the tagset size 
by one (eg by shifting the tags by one), and use the free tag for AENs).
That would have to be coded within the driver, though.

If that's a solution which you like better I could give it a go.

Cheers,

Hannes
