Personally, I'm not a big fan of using procfs to display driver status.
I would rather move this interface to debugfs and declare the existing 
interface as deprecated.
We probably would need to observe the usual rules etc (compat functions, 
compile-time config etc), but I really would like to deprecate using 
procfs in SCSI...

Cheers,

Hannes
