Hi David,

ESXi is one of the hosts that inspects Third Party Copy VPD Page.
Windows detects ODX support using the page [1][2].

The page is also used by libiscsi to detect presence and features of
copy manager as was agreed with Bart in the PR [3]:

"Implementing REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES in LIO would require more
work than implementing the third-party copy VPD page.

I'm fine with relying on the third-party copy VPD page, or in other
words, to skip the copy offloading tests if that page is not supported.

There are plans to implement XCOPY support in the Linux kernel sd
driver. If nobody else volunteers I plan to work on this myself. I'm
considering to only support SCSI targets that support the third-party
copy VPD page. Or in other words, we will need support for that VPD page
anyway."

It's doable but would require to change the signature of all existing
VPD handlers. SE_INQUIRY_BUF is hardcoded to 1kb but it's also capped by
EDTL to avoid buffer overruns:

  memcpy(rbuf, buf, min_t(u32, SE_INQUIRY_BUF, cmd->data_length));

Roman
