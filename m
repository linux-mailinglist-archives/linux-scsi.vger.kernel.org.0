But we do, don't we?
Commands are being returned with the appropriate status, and 
dm-multipath should make the corresponding decisions here.
This patch just modifies the check when _sending_ commands; ie multipath 
had decided that the path is still usable.

Question rather would be why multipath did that; however that logic 
isn't modified here.

Cheers,

Hannes
