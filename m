 From my perspective this is a proof-of-concept; using xarrays to store 
targets and LUNs has the benefit that we can directly access the 
elements, and the lookup will be more efficient for larger setups.

But it's not a clear-cut solution, merely replacing one concept with 
some issues with another concept with another set of issues.

Guess the real benefit will come only if we manage to move to explicit 
scsi target removal, and not the implicit model of making the scsi 
target dependent on the underlying scsi devices we have now.
I'll be experimenting with that and will post an update for it.

I _do_ like the xarray for targets, though; they have a fixed location 
where they can go and as such xarray are a far more natural choice.
For LUNs it's less compelling as xarrays can't use 64bits generically as 
index, but still.

Cheers,

Hannes
