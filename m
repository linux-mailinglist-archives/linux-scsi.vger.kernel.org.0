Yes, I now better understand what is going on, somewhat.
The patch I sent corrects the suspend side: the scsi device will be suspended
first, which triggers issuing an IDLE command to spin down the drive, then that
ATA port is suspended. All good. However, this patch does not address the resume
side.

The ata port is resumed first. This operation is rather quick and only trigger
ata EH asynchronously. The scsi device is resumed after the ata port. This
operation triggers issuing a VERIFY command to spinup the drive and put it back
in the active power state. Media access commands like VERIFY are the only
commands that restore a disk to active state. However, the "no start on resume"
patch I sent disables that, which is wrong. But reverting it is also not a full
solution as there is no way to know when the VERIFY command will be issued with
regard to ata EH triggered. That verify command should be issued after the port
is resumed and before the revalidation start !

I suspect that you get your lockup with the no start on resume patch because the
revalidation never proceeds correctly as the drive is still sleeping. And things
work with the patch reverted as you get lucky and the VERIFY command makes it
through at the right timing... Would need to add more messages to confirm all
this. I still cannot really explain the hard lockup though as in the end, you
should be seeing command timeouts, port reset, retries, and eventually drive
removal.

Anyway, what is clear is that using scsi manage_start_stop cannot possibly work
for resume. So more patches are needed to move the IDLE and VERIFY commands to
libata EH so that these commands are issued within the EH context instead of the
scsi device suspend/resume context.

Working on that. I should have patches ready for you Monday.

Too bad... I really would like to understand where things get deadlocked.

So we have:
4:0:0:0 -> ata5 port
5:0:0:0 -> ata6 port
7:0:0:0 -> ata8 port

The messages below come from libata EH which was triggered asynchronously and
end up running after PM exit, which is fine as PM does not need to wait for the
drive to spin up.

Looks like libata EH is finished here. And then comes the next suspend.

Looks like ata EH from the previous resume was actually not finished and
completes here.

Looks like the drives have all come back but there is no "PM exit" to be seen,
so I suspect the scsi device resume side is stuck... Not sure why, especially
with the "no start on resume" patch.

Will send patches to fix all this as soon as possible.
