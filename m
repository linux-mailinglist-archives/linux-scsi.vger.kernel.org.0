Is the comment in sonic_interrupt() outdated according to this:
m68k: irq: Remove IRQF_DISABLED
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=77a4279
http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1109.2/01687.html

and this:
genirq: Warn when handler enables interrupts
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b738a50a

wouldn't genirq report a warning on m68k?
