Right

I could do that. But I think that the command just does not complete. Or 
maybe it is missed.

I don't know why the driver even does this, but the implementation of 
pm80xx_send_read_log() is questionable. It would be nice to not see ATA 
code in the driver like this.

ok, in a way that is a relief.

As above, I doubt the implemenation of that code. It alloc's a domain 
device itself, which is not how things should be done.

I did try fio a while ago and it worked ok. Strange.

I got a few more things to try but need to make progress on my libsas 
series now ...
