It fixes that very specific issue, but it leaves others. Maybe it could
be used in a patchset that builds on it?

I think we could hit issues like:

1. tcm_loop_port_unlink runs and releases tl_tpg_port_count count.
2. userspace initiated scan commands were in progress and complete.
target_fabric_port_unlink->core_dev_del_lun->core_tpg_remove_lun was
waiting for those last IOs and now completes and deletes the mapped lun
from lio.
3. scsi-ml scan completed before the unmapping and so now we have a
scsi_device but no lio lun mapping.


The problem with this is that:

1. We can hit mismatched settings like this:

A. We now have this scsi_device at LUN0, but no lio mapping. User thinks
everything got cleaned up ok, so they decide to map another lio lun.
B. tcm_loop_port_link just does a scsi_add_device which does
scsi_probe_and_add_lun with rescan=true. So the original scsi_device is
returned. It is not reprobed so whatever settings the old device has
will be used. Maybe that scsi_device was for a disk and now the user was
adding a CD.

2. And hit races like:

A. tl_tpg_port_count might now be zero so the tpg and nexus can be removed.
B. That removal can race with IO being sent to the scsi_device. If a
command has passed tcm_loop_submission_work's NULL tl_nexus check then
we will hit a NULL pointer crash later in the function.
