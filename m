I am using 8150mtp and you can see the DTS at [1]
with this patch I get phy timeout error

[    2.532594] qcom-qmp-phy 1d87000.phy: phy initialization timed-out

If i revert this patch the Timeout goes away. UFS node for this platform
is enabled in [2] and [3]

I did add the GPIO as well for testing but that doesnt work, only thing
that makes it work is rename the reset line to something other that 'rst'

I found that with this patch the reset is invoked twice, not sure why!

The 845 does not define a reset 'rst' but both 8150 and 8998 define
that!

Yes both are added for UFS and I am testing with these..

Please see drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-sm8150.c upstream

Yup, added:

        reset-gpios = <&tlmm 175 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
