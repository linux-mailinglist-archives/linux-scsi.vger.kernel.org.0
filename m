All the same functionality would need to be supported, and I think that
shoehorning it into the keyrings service instead of just adding new ioctls would
be more difficult.  The keyrings service was not designed for this use case.
We've already had a lot of problems trying to take advantage of the keyrings
service in fscrypt previously.  The keyrings service is something that sounds
useful but really isn't all that useful.

By "a single IOCTL to point the block device to the key in the keyring", you
seem to be referring to configuring full block device encryption with a single
key.  That's not something that's supported by the upstream kernel yet, and it's
not related to this patchset; currently only fscrypt supports inline encryption.
Support for it will be added at some point, which will likely indeed take the
form of an ioctl to set a key on a block device.  But that would be the case
even without HW-wrapped keys.  And *requiring* the key to be given in a keyring
(instead of just in a byte array passed to the ioctl) isn't very helpful, as it
just makes the API harder to use.  We've learned this from the fscrypt API
already where we actually had to move away from the keyrings service in order to
fix all the issues caused by it (see FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY).

Sure, that's just a matter of hardware capabilities though, right?  The block
layer provides a way for drivers to declare which inline encryption capabilities
they support.  They can declare they support standard keys, HW-wrapped keys,
both, or neither.  If Qualcomm SoCs can't support both types of keys at the same
time, that's unfortunate, but I'm not sure what your point is.  The user (e.g.
fscrypt) still has control over whether they use the functionality that the
hardware provides.
