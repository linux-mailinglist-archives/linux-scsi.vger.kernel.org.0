32 bit machines can't kmap more than size_t - so this is not
correct. We can't put sgl tables into highmem.

IIRC, I changed it to obviously avoid integer promotion/truncation
issues. It is better to handle those with correct typing than
introducing a bunch of frail checks. We don't need to worry about the
extra 32 bits in something like this.

So fix them. It is why we have one git tree. You'll get sympathy if it
is more than 5-10 :)

Uh, if someone is "peeved" they are not understanding how kernel APIs
are expected to evolve, I think.

It should be two patches, one to correct the types in the function
signature, and another to resolve the 4G problem.

Which is consistent with how the community views in-kernel APIs.
