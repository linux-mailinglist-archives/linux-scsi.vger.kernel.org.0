Indeed. As per the Linux kernel Web site [1]: 5.5 and 5.9 are not 
maintained anymore (EOL) upstream. So, if distributions decided to go 
with another Linux kernel release, itâ€™s their job to backport things. If 
the commit message is well written, and contains the Fixes tag, their 
tooling should be able to pick it up.


Kind regards,

Paul
