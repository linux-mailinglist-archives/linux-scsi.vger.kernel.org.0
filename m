I think I have now figured it out, and fixed. I could reliably recreate the same
hang both with qemu using a failed suspend (using a device not supporting
suspend) and real hardware with a short rtc wake.

It turns out that the root cause of the hang is ata_scsi_dev_rescan(), which is
scheduled asynchronously from PM context on resume. With quick suspend after a
resume, suspend may win the race against that ata_scsi_dev_rescan() task
execution and we endup calling scsi_rescan_device() on a suspended device,
causing that function to wait with the device_lock() held, which causes PM to
deadlock when it needs to resume the scsi device. The recent commit 6aa0365a3c85
("ata: libata-scsi: Avoid deadlock on rescan after device resume") was intended
to fix that, but it did so less than ideally and the fix has a race on the scsi
power state check, thus not always preventing the resume hang.

I pushed a new patch series that goes on top of 6.5.0: resume-v3 branch in the
libata tree:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dlemoal/libata.git

This works very well for me. Using this script on real hardware:

for (( i=0; i<20; i++ )); do
	echo "+2" > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
	echo mem > /sys/power/state
done

The system repeatedly suspends and resumes and comes back OK. Of note is that if
I set the delay to +1 second, then I sometime do not see the system resume and
the script stops. But using wakeup-on-lan (wol command) from another machine to
wake it up, the machine resumes normally and continues executing the script. So
it seems that setting the rtc alarm unreasonably early result in it being lost
and the system suspending wating to be woken up.

I also tested this in qemu. As mentioned before, I cannot get rtc alarm to wake
up the VM guest though. However, using a virtio device that does not support
suspend, resume strats in the middle of the suspend operation due to the suspend
error reported by that device. And it turns out that systemd really insists on
suspending the system despite the error, so when running "systemctl suspend" I
see a retry for suspend right after the first failed one. That is enough to
trigger the issue without the patches.

Please test !

Thanks.
