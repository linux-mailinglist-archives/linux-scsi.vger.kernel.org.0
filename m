You can't have it both ways.

The underlying problem is this:
The csiostor driver (and several others, too) require a valid hardware 
tag to send a LU reset command. Currently it tries to allocate a tag 
from the pool of free hardware tags.
However, experience shows that the majority of cases (in my personal 
experience _all_ of the cases) where we ever entered the error handler 
are due to command timeouts. If now all commands timed out, the tag 
space is full and we cannot get a free tag to send the LU reset command.
Hence LU reset will currently fail in this case.
With the patchset we will always ensure to have at least one free tag
such that we can send the LU reset command. But, as correctly noted,
it will reduce the available tagspace and possibly reduce the performance.
But you really can have it both ways. Either you go for max performance 
and have the risk of starving the error handler, or you go for 
reliability and accept a (slightly) lower performance.
And, btw, I'm not sure if one could even measure the performance impact.
csiostor has 2048 tags per HBA with a 10G FCoE link. So it would require 
a latency of less than 8us with 4k I/O to saturate the HBA; for 
everything slower we wouldn't be seeing anything.

Cheers,

Hannes
