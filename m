Great, thanks for testing.

Note that the benchmark you ran (creating many small files, then deleting them)
mostly tests the performance of filenames encryption and directory operations,
not file contents encryption.  Inline encryption is only used for file contents.

In fact, since that benchmark doesn't sync the files before deleting them, there
is no guarantee that any file contents are actually written to disk, and hence
no guarantee that inline encryption got used at all.

It would be more relevant to test the performance of reading/writing file data.

Also, did you try doing any correctness tests?  (See what I suggested earlier.)
