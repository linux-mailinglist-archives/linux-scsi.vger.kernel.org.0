Personally, I consider it as such because the retry to process the
remaining will necessarily fail, or worse, do bad things to the drive
sectors, since the addressing is off by a factor of 8. Retrying the
remaining of any of these "unaligned" commands is dangerous. For a read,
this can lead to data leaks, and for a write, that can destroy the FS on
the disk.
