Greeting my dear,

I am Miss.Nadia Abass. by name, The only daughter of late MR. MOGAMAT
ASHRAF ABASS,  My father was the manager of one of the biggest oil and
gas company here in Benin Republic, when was alive.

After he was poisoned by his business associates which he suffered and
died. Before the death of my father, He left  about ( USD 750,000.00
United State Dollars ) which he deposited with UBA Bank here Benin
Republic and i am his next of kin.

It was the money he intended to transfer overseas for other of his
project before he was poisoned. I have been to the UBA Bank to claim
the funds but the director of the Bank told me that i am not allow to
operate my late fathers account because of the security Claus my
father placed on the account which stated that i must come up to 30
years old before i will be allow to start operating the accoun.

But the manager of the Bank also advised me that since i need the
money very urgent i should look for a good and honest foreign partners
in overseas to be my trustee and help me receive the funds on my
behalf and help me invest it into any good profitable business as i do
not have any business experience to manage such huge amount of money
on my own.

Please am seeking for your kind assistance in the following ways:  (1)
to provide a safe bank account where the money will be transferred for
the investment project. (2) To serve as a guardian of this funds since
I am a girl of 26 years old. (3) To make arrangement for me to come
over to your country to further my education. This is my reason for
writing to you. Please if you are interested to help me in this case
kindly feel free to contact me back immediately. on my email;
missnadiaabass6@gmail.com

Yours faithful.
Nadia Abass.
