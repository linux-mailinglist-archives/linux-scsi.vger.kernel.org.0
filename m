Sure, but if you move dead code, it creates churn which can lead to merge 
conflicts. And such changes still require code review.

Also, you'd lose an opportunity to delete the dead code, which is a pity, 
since that would then require a separate patch.

Well, the driver can't be understood from the code alone. The datasheet 
will always be required reading.

Now that I understand the relationship between UID and Family, I see why 
you did this.

Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.
