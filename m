In my working tree, I've changed that to:

* scsi_alloc_target - allocate a new or find an existing target
  * @parent:     may point to the parent shost, or an intermediate object
  *              that dev_to_shost() can resolve to the parent shost
  * @channel:    target channel number (zero if no channels)
  * @id:         target id number

Hinting at what is actually happening.

One aspect of xarray operations is that they are performed on the
collection holder (a scsi_host::__targets in this case), not so much on
the collected objects where it has a smaller footprint than list_head.
So I would be inclined to add a scsi_target::parent_shost pointer and
have a trivial:
   static inline struct Scsi_Host *starg_to_shost(struct scsi_target *starg) {}
accessor.

A qualified success, so far. See below.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/xarray.html

Of xarray it says:
"It is more memory-efficient, parallelisable and cache friendly than
a doubly-linked list. It takes advantage of RCU to perform lookups
without locking."  M. Wilcox in the overview of that linked document.


The use of list_head objects to hold together the scsi mid-level
object tree is a mess, IMO. That makes it hard to maintain and possibly
inefficient. The fact that whoever added the scsi_target's collection
of scsi_device-s could not see the obvious way to iterate over that
collection is an example.

list_head based collections (as currently used) take spinlocks on
both modifying and non-modifying operations. An interesting aspect
of xarrays is that they have integrated locking and take cheaper
rcu locks for iterations which are mostly involved with non-modifying
operations. That integrated locking is both an advantage (it is
well instrumented in the case of xarray) and creates difficulties
when retrofitting xarrays in the place of list_head based collections
which have "roll your own" type locking.


Testing? Yes plenty of it. And things break, just not yet in the scsi
subsystem :-)  With the attached script, first my laptop goes into
thermal throttling, then a few minutes later systemd-udev seems
to lose it, spraying blocks of these messages in the log:
   xtwo70 systemd-udevd[9453]: 4:0:8:15: Failed to process device, ignoring: 
File exists

and leaking memory at the same time (based on that "age") in the kernel:
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
unreferenced object 0xffff88815929e000 (size 8192):
    comm "modprobe", pid 14214, jiffies 4297239717 (age 743.446s)

The script does complete and my laptop seems normal.
It is hard to verify correctness and any performance gains when systemd
and udev are eating most of the processor resources.
