Maybe we agree.

I was calling #2 a cmd lifetime issue. At least loop, xen and iscsi think they can access the cmd after aborted_cmd. For loop/xen we just don't hit it, because we hit #1 first. For iscsi we are.

For xen and #1 and #2 I agree we can do a similar fix as you did for xen.

I would really like to figure out if #2 is a regression and understand what happened so we don't make the same mistake again and also fix iscsi. The problem with iscsi though is every couple kernels has a bug in this code path so git bisect is being a pain.
