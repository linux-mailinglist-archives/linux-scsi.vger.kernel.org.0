Bumping the sg driver version number is simple:

And bumping the version number is appropriate for an interface
tweak/correction.

I'm rewriting the sg driver currently (12 months and counting) and am up
to version 11 of the _first_ half. So far I'm using a sg_version_num of
 > 40000 for the rewritten code. Please keep away from version numbers
40000 and above.

The rewritten driver is documented here:
     https://doug-gilbert.github.io/sg_v40.html

and its ioctls are listed in Table 8, including the BLK* ones. Perhaps you
could suggest some corrections. Obviously BLKSSZGET needs to be added
when your patches are accepted.
