I was aware of it, but I confused matters for some cases :-/

There's also the error handler retrying commands e.g. after a
successful abort. This is the DID_TIME_OUT case, actually -
scsi_decide_disposition() never calls scsi_noretry_cmd() for
DID_TIME_OUT.

Overlooked that, thanks.

Right, thanks for pointing that out. I saw it but didn't realize what
it meant.

Not quite following you here - alua_check_sense() is called for any
command, not just those submitted from the ALUA code.

Me too, but I'm not sure about Christoph.

I don't think it's _that_ speficic. (retries < allowed) is the default
case, at least for the first failure. REQ_FAILFAST_DEV has very few
users except for the device handlers, and NEEDS_RETRY is a rather
frequently used disposition.

If we don't want to fall back to 1. above, I think we can go a long way
with two additional flags for scsi_execute() callers:

 a) indicate whether DID_TIME_OUT should be retried by the error
handler (default: no),
 b) indicate whether UA (and NOT READY?) should be retried on the ML
(default: current behavior)

The rationale for b) is that (IIRC from yesterday's code inspection all
callers that check sense codes only define special cases for UA, or
some subcases of it.

Maybe we need also

 c) indicate whether the (don't) retry logic for SG_IO should be used.

I agree. I thought about passing a lookup table of sense keys (not) to
be retried to the ML, but it feels over-engineered to me.=20

Thanks
