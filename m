The whole stack needs to treat SAM_STAT_CONDITION_MET as a non-error.
However the complex multi-layer return values are represented,
reducing them to a comparison with zero, spread all over the
stack just seems bad software engineering. IMO a predicate function
(i.e. returning bool) is needed.

I would argue that in the right circumstances, the sd driver should
indeed by using PRE-FETCH. It would need help from the upper layers.
It is essentially "read-ahead" in the case where the next LBA
does not follow the last read LBA. A smarter read-ahead ...
