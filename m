Yeah, any counter(include atomic counter) works in this way.

But here it may be 'permanent' because one stale request pointer may stay in
one slot of ->rqs[] for long enough time if this slot isn't reused, meantime
the same request can be reallocated in case of real io scheduler. Maybe the
commit log should be improved a bit for making it explicit.

It shouldn't be possible, since ->rqs[] is per-tags. If it is shared bit
map, both tag#5 and tag#10 are set, and both shared_tags->rqs[5] &
shared_tags->rqs[10] should point to the updated requests(timed out).

It should be same with yours, and the original report described & explained
the issue in details.
