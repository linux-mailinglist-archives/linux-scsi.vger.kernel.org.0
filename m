Subject: [PATCH v11 0/2] Enable power management for ufs wlun 
Date:   Thu, 11 Mar 2021 14:19:33 -0800
Message-Id: <cover.1615500685.git.asutoshd@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-scsi.vger.kernel.org>

This patch attempts to fix a deadlock in ufs while sending SSU.
Recently, blk_queue_enter() added a check to not process requests if the
queue is suspended. That leads to a resume of the associated device which
is suspended. In ufs, that device is ufs device wlun and it's parent is
ufs_hba. This resume tries to resume ufs device wlun which in turn tries
to resume ufs_hba, which is already in the process of suspending, thus
causing a deadlock.

This patch takes care of:
* Suspending the ufs device lun only after all other luns are suspended
* Sending SSU during ufs device wlun suspend
* Clearing uac for rpmb and ufs device wlun
* Not sending commands to the device during host suspend

v10 -> v11:
- Fixed supplier suspending before consumer race
- Addressed Adrian's comments
  * Added proper resume/suspend cb to ufshcd_auto_hibern8_update()
  * Cosmetic changes to ufshcd-pci.c
  * Cleaned up ufshcd_system_suspend()
  * Added ufshcd_debugfs_eh_exit to ufshcd_core_init()

v9 -> v10:
- Addressed Adrian's comments
  * Moved suspend/resume vops to __ufshcd_wl_[suspend/resume]()
  * Added correct resume in ufs_bsg

v8 -> v9:
- Addressed Adrian's comments
  * Moved link transition to __ufshcd_wl_[suspend/resume]()
  * Fixed the other minor comments

v7 -> v8:
- Addressed Adrian's comments
  * Removed separate autosuspend delay for ufs-device lun
  * Fixed the ee handler getting scheduled during pm
  * Always runtime resume in suspend_prepare()
  * Added CONFIG_PM_SLEEP where needed
  
v6 -> v7:
  * Resume the ufs device before shutting it down

v5 -> v6:
- Addressed Adrian's comments
  * Added complete() cb
  * Added suspend_prepare() and complete() to all drivers
  * Moved suspend_prepare() and complete() to ufshcd
  * .poweroff() uses ufhcd_wl_poweroff()
  * Removed several forward declarations
  * Moved scsi_register_driver() to ufshcd_core_init()

v4 -> v5:
- Addressed Adrian's comments
  * Used the rpmb driver contributed by Adrian
  * Runtime-resume the ufs device during suspend to honor spm-lvl
  * Unregister the scsi_driver in ufshcd_remove()
  * Currently shutdown() puts the ufs device to power-down mode
    so, just removed ufshcd_pci_poweroff()
  * Quiesce the scsi device during shutdown instead of remove

v3 RFC -> v4:
- Addressed Bart's comments
  * Except that I didn't get any checkpatch failures
- Addressed Avri's comments
- Addressed Adrian's comments
  * Added a check for deepsleep power mode
  * Removed a couple of forward declarations
  * Didn't separate the scsi drivers because in rpmb case it just sends uac
    in resume and it seemed pretty neat to me.
- Added sysfs changes to resume the devices before accessing
