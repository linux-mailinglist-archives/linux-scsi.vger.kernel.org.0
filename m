Then use one of the other many other unique ids that are in /dev/disk/
today.  You have loads of things to choose from:
	$ ls /dev/disk/
	by-diskseq  by-id  by-label  by-partlabel  by-partuuid  by-path  by-uuid

You have a plethera of choices here, use whatever works best for your
systems.  This is a userspace decision to make, not a kernel one, as
this is a policy choice of yours.

good luck!
