Sorry if the phrasing was unclear there - the allusion to default 
domains is new, it just occurred to me that what we do there is in fact 
fairly close to what I've suggested previously for this. In that case, 
we have a global policy set by the command line, which *can* be 
overridden per-domain via sysfs at runtime, provided the user is willing 
to tear the whole thing down. Using a similar approach here would give a 
fair degree of flexibility but still mean that changes never have to be 
made dynamically to a live domain.

Robin.
