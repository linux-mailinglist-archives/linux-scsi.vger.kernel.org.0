IIUC, your claim is that CONFIG_LOCKDEP involves code that contains the=20
inference, "arch_irqs_disabled() means all interrupts have been masked".

Unfortunately, m68k lacks CONFIG_LOCKDEP support so I can't easily confirm=
=20
this. I suppose there may be other architectures that support both LOCKDEP=
=20
and nested interrupts (?)

Anyway, if you would point to the code that contains said inference, that=
=20
would help a lot.

>=20

Again, you don't see that warning because irqs_disabled() correctly=20
returns true. You can confirm this fact in QEMU or Aranym if you are=20
interested.

>=20

Again, the stack overflow issue is not applicable. 68000 uses a priority=20
mask, like ARM GIC. So there's no arbitrary nesting of interrupt handlers.=
=20

In practice stack overflows simply don't occur on m68k. Please do try it.

We can't get agreement because you seek to remove functionality without=20

So, a platform should do what all the other platforms do because to=20

>=20

So, some interrupt (or exception) processing happens atomically and the=20
rest is deferred to a different execution context. (Not a new idea.)

If you introduce latency in the former context you can't win it back in=20
the latter. Your solution fails because it adds latency to high priority=20
handlers.

No, m68k runs well because it uses priority masking. It is not because=20
some cases are untested.

Your hardware may not have been around for 4 decades but it implements the=
=20
same capability because the design is known to work.

If you think that lockdep or some other code somewhere should be protected=
=20
in this way, perhaps you can point to that code. Otherwise, your patch=20
seems to lack any justification.
