The queue type change causes patches not applied any more.

Could you just test the patch against v4.15 and see if there is any
improvement?

Even if it may improve performance on hisi_sas, I still suggest to not
use that approach to solve the issue for draining in-flight requests when
all CPUs of one hw queue becomes offline, since this way might hurt
performance on other drivers.

The unique tag has zero cost, see blk_mq_unique_tag().

It is allowed to block in CPU hotplug handler.

.prep_queue_dead() is run from blk-mq's CPU hotplug handler.

I also think of abstracting completion queue in blk-mq for hpsa,
hisi_sas_v3_hw and  mpt3sas, but that can't cover to drain device's internal
command, so looks it is inevitable for us to introduce driver callback.
