While we are on this topic, another similar concern is how to set the 
UFS's regulators loading to Low Power Mode (LPM).
Currently, the UFS_VREG_LPM_LOAD_UA is hardcoded to 1mA in the driver, 
and it is invoked by the ufshcd_config_vreg_lpm().
However, for some platforms, to put the regulators into LPM mode, it may 
be a different value than 1mA.
Should we be using ufs_vreg's min_uA in the ufshcd_config_vreg_lpm() 
instead of using the hardcoded value?
And the ufs_vreg's min_uA value would be parsed by the vendor's code?
We can post a proposal if this sounds ok.

Bao
