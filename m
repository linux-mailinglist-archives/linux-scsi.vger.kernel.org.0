As the issue was found after system resumes, so the issue was discovered
during system suspend/resume test, and it is very easy to be replicated.
After system resumes, if this issue hits some scsi devices, all bios 
sent
to their request queues are blocked, which may cause a system hang if 
the
scsi devices are vital to system functionality.

To make sure the patch work well, we have tested system suspend/resume
and made sure no system hang happen due to request queues got blocked
by imbalanced pm_only counter.

Thanks,

Can Guo.
