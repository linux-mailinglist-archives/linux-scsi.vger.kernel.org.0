I think it's fine as long as you do things in the correct order: the
copy into the bounce buffer has to be done before the
dma_map_single() here, and conversely, the copy out of the
bounce buffer must happen after the dma_unmap_single().

Regarding the amiga_chip_alloc(), I don't know what this means
for caching. If chip memory is cache-coherent (either uncached
or by snooping), then there should not be any
dma_map()/dma_unmap() for that case, but instead the
amiga_chip_alloc() function should return both the pointer
and the dma_addr_t token.
