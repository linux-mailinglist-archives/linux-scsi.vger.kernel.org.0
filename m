Alternatively you could drop task abort (in favour of doing a task set
abort/lun reset); that way your current tag allocation strategy would
work and we can think of command abort later.

Which will be even more of an issue once my patchset for private
commands in SCSI goes in (note to self: resend); there are other drivers
which will suffer from precisely this issue, too.

I'll be reviewing the other patches shortly.

Cheers,

Hannes
