One last thing. The issue I was looking at a few weeks ago turned out
to be that mpt3sas frees and unmaps the trace buffer in
mpt3sas_ctl_exit(), but doesn't appear to tell the fw about it so it
keeps trying to write to the trace buffer while the soft reset
happens. I don't know if should be doing something like
ctl_diag_unregister(), or something else? I thought I saw an email
from Tomas, but couldn't find it so I thought I'd bring that to your
attention.

Regards,
Jerry
