Hi Stanley,
I think that'd work, but there's definitely a penalty of keeping Vcc ON.
And if we do want to keep it ON, then we'd have to measure how much 
excess power is being used - after the flush is done.

I think setting keep_curr_dev_pwr_mode to true iff h8 and ah8 are 
enabled is a good idea. In addition to that, adding a timer to check 
flush status if keep_curr_dev_pwr_mode is set to true would keep the 
power consumption to a minimum. So I suggest to have the delayed check 
of flush status as well.

Thanks,
-asd
