I'd rather not go this way.
We should not try to preserve the split SCSI result value with its four 
distinct fields.

I'd rather have the message byte handling moved into the SCSI parallel 
drivers (where really it should've been in the first place).
The driver byte can go entirely as the DRIVER_SENSE flag can be replaced
with a check for valid sense code, DRIVER_TIMEOUT is pretty much 
identical to DID_TIMEOUT (with the semantic difference _who_ set the 
timeout), and DRIVER_ERROR can be folded back into the caller.
All other values are unused, allowing us to drop driver error completely.

With that we're only having two fields (host byte and status byte) left,
which should be treated as two distinct values.

As it so happens I do have a patchset for this; guess I'll be posting it 
to demonstrate the idea.

Bart, I would very much prefer if we could work on this together so as 
to avoid duplicate work.

Cheers,

Hannes
