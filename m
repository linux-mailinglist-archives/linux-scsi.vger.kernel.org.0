Quick follow up, only saw this now while posting something to the
ticket: according to one reporter the problem even causes data damage.
To quote:

'''
if you run fsck.ext4 on ext4 file system with buggy kernel it will
damage file system and its data

using buggy kernel BTRFS scrub also says that checksums are wrong
'''

Ciao, Thorsten
