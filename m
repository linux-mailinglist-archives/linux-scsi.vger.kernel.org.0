Wow, that sounds like a lot of work.

Let's start with the 39-second run for the 10-MB file.  If you can put 
the trace files on a server somewhere, available for downloading, that 
would avoid sending a lot of uninteresting data to the mailing list.

Odd that the delays never occur when you're writing a new file.  (If
nothing else, that gives you a way to work around the problem!)  It's
hard to say what it means, though.  Maybe the flash drive doesn't like 
overwriting used blocks.
