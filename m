Thanks for looking into it again. I need some more guidance from your
part in order to be able to resubmit the set in a form that you
consider ready for merging.

I'm not sure what code you're referring to. Is it the processing of the
bytes of the SCSI result code? If yes, please note that I had changed
that to open-coded form in response to Bart's review of my v2
submission. If it's something else, please point it out to me.

To minimize the special-casing for this code path, Hannes suggested to
use a target-specific unprepare_ioctl() callback to to tell the generic
dm code whether a given ioctl could be retried. The logic that I've put
into dm-scsi_ioctl.c could then be moved into the unprepare_ioctl()
callback of dm-mpath. dm_blk_ioctl() would need to check the callback's
return value and possibly retry the ioctl. Would hat appeal to you?

Not cc'ing linux-scsi was my oversight, sorry about that. 

But I don't quite understand what interfaces you have in mind. SCSI
needs to expose the SG_IO interface to dm, which it does; I just needed
to export sg_io() to get access to the sg_io_hdr fields. The question
whether a given IO can be retried is decided on the dm (-mpath) layer,
based on blk_status_t; no additional interface on the SCSI side is
necessary for that.

My current code uses the device handler indirectly for activating paths
during priority group switching, via the dm-mpath prepare_ioctl()
method and __pg_init_all_paths(). This is what I intended - to use
exactly the same logic for SG_IO which is used for regular read/write
IO on the block device. What additional functionality for the device
handler do you have in mind?

Regards and thanks,
Martin
