I don't understand the nature of the relationship between the ATA port
and the corresponding SCSI device.  Maybe you could explain it more
fully, if you have time.

But in any case, this approach seems like a layering violation.  Why not 
instead call a SCSI utility routine to set a "needs_rescan" flag in the 
scsi_device structure?  Then scsi_device_resume() could automatically 
call scsi_rescan_device() -- or rather an internal version that assumes 
the device lock is already held -- if the flag is set.  Or it could 
queue a non-delayed work routine to do this.  (Is it important to have 
the rescan finish before userspace starts up and tries to access the ATA 
device again?)

That, combined with a guaranteed order of resuming, would do what you 
want, right?
