I wrote auto to /sys/block/sd[ef]/device/power/config and 10000 to
/sys/block/sd[ef]/device/power/auto_suspend_delay_ms, and auto to the
control file of their corresponding ata8 port ( both drives are behind
an PMP in an eSATA dock on ata8 ).  As I said before, it the dmesg
showed that the ata port only suspended after BOTH drives had suspended,
which is as it should be.  The problem seems to be after I echo 1 >
/sys/block/sdf/device/delete, when this happens:

Oct 26 16:43:00 faldara kernel: ata8.15: failed to read PMP GSCR[0] (Emask=0x100)
Oct 26 16:43:00 faldara kernel: ata8.15: PMP revalidation failed (errno=-5)
Oct 26 16:43:05 faldara kernel: ata8.15: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123 SControl 300)
Oct 26 16:43:05 faldara kernel: ata8.00: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123 SControl 320)
Oct 26 16:43:05 faldara kernel: ata8.01: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus
123 SControl 320)

Then I get the hung task.  I reverted the PuiS patch that I have been
working on, and the hang no longer happens, however, the above errors do
still happen.  I think that is a problem in itself, and may or may not
be related to the hang.  I see no reason why the PMP revalidation should
fail after the two disks and the port are runtime pm suspended, but for
some reason, with my patch applied, that then leads to the hang.

Here is my git log showing your two patches applied on the upstream
kernel, plus my patch:

    Olibata: don't start disks on resume
    
    Disks with Power Up In Standby enabled that required the
    SET FEATURES command to start up were being issued the
    command during resume.  Suppress this until the disk
    is actually accessed.

    [PATCH 2/2] ata: libata-core: Improve ata_dev_power_set_active()
    
    Improve the function ata_dev_power_set_active() by having it do nothing
    for a disk that is already in the active power state. To do that,
    introduce the function ata_dev_power_is_active() to test the current
    power state of the disk and return true if the disk is in the PM0:
    active or PM1: idle state (0xff value for the count field of the CHECK
    POWER MODE command output).
    
    To preserve the existing behavior, if the CHECK POWER MODE command
    issued in ata_dev_power_is_active() fails, the drive is assumed to be in
    standby mode and false is returned.
    
    With this change, issuing the VERIFY command to access the disk media to
    spin it up becomes unnecessary most of the time during system resume as
    the port reset done by libata-eh on resume often result in the drive to
    spin-up (this behavior is not clearly defined by the ACS specifications
    and may thus vary between disk models).

    ata: libata-eh: Spinup disk on resume after revalidation
    
    Move the call to ata_dev_power_set_active() to transition a disk in
    standby power mode to the active power mode from
    ata_eh_revalidate_and_attach() before doing revalidation to the end of
    ata_eh_recover(), after the link speed for the device is reconfigured
    (if that was necessary). This is safer as this ensure that the VERIFY
    command executed to spinup the disk is executed with the drive properly
    reconfigured first.

    Pull input fixes from Dmitry Torokhov:
    
     - a reworked way for handling reset delay on SMBus-connected Synaptics
       touchpads (the original one, while being correct, uncovered an old
       bug in fallback to PS/2 code that was fixed separately; the new one
       however avoids having delay in serio port "fast" resume, and instead
       has the wait in the RMI4 code)
    
     - a fix for potential crashes when devices with Elan controllers (and
       Synaptics) fall back to PS/2 code. Can't be hit without the original
       patch above, but still good to have it fixed
    
     - a couple new device IDs in xpad Xbox driver
    
     - another quirk for Goodix driver to deal with stuff vendors put in
       ACPI tables
    
     - a fix for use-after-free on disconnect for powermate driver
    
     - a quirk to not initialize PS/2 mouse port on Fujitsu Lifebook E5411
       laptop as it makes keyboard not usable and the device uses
       hid-over-i2c touchpad anyways

And here is my patch, which basically checks for PuiS during system
resume, and either forces the disk to suspend or resume depending on
whether it is PuiS.  Since I have not even engaged in any system
suspend/resume for this test, this patch should not have any effect.

So far in my testing of this patch on my 3 internal drives that I have
enabled PuiS on, it appears to work in so much as after a
suspend/resume, the runtime status of the disks is suspended ( as long
as I have *enabled* runtime pm on them, otherwise not ).  Another
problem seems to be that while the disks are left suspended after system
resume, they very quickly are resumed due to begnign IO eminating from
either ext4 or udsisks2 that does not cause a drive to spin up when it
is suspended with hdparm -y.  This would be the case of either FLUSH
CASH or CHECK POWER CONDITION not causing the drive to spin itself up
when given the commands, but the runtime pm core does not know that
these commands can be completed without resuming the disk, so it resumes
them first.
