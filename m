Hi,
writing politely in reply to your politeness :). I upgraded to 5.15.131. I
need a stable system and do not want to jump that far to 6.x.

But it seems this issue is related to a defect in the firmware of the
controller. I will try to reflash a newer version during the week. I hope
it helps.

Current version is 01.26.00.00 (see [1]). In the readme[2], I read

Phase21 Pre-Alpha Release Version 00.33.01.00 - SAS1_FW_Ph_21
(SCGCQ00177063) Change Summary ( Defects=5)
SCGCQ00173656 (DFCT) - 6G SATA drive negotiates to 1.5G speed

I will also check the BIOS settings, when in front of the machine it could
be that link speed is enforcable

BR
