I don't know about other SCSI LLDs, but UFS error handling is basically
doing a re-probe/re-initialization to UFS device. Having UFS error 
handling
running in parallel with system suspend/resume, neither of them will end
up well.

I didn't design all this, it is just happening, I am trying to fix it 
and
semaphore works well for me. I am really glad to see someone cares about
error handling and fix it with better ideas (maybe using WQ_FREEZABLE) 
later.

Sure, host_sem is actually preventing cocurrency happens among any of
contexts, such as sysfs access, shutdown, error handling, system
suspend/resume and async probe, I will update its message in next 
version.
