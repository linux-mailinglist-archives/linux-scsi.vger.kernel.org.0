Let me explain it one more time:

When one IRQ flood happens on one CPU:

1) softirq handling on this CPU can't make progress

2) kernel thread bound to this CPU can't make progress

For example, network may require softirq to xmit packets, or another irq
thread for handling keyboards/mice or whatever, or rcu_sched may depend
on that CPU for making progress, then the irq flood stalls the whole
system.

Usually medium may not be faster than CPU, now we are talking about
interrupts, which can be originated from lots of devices concurrently,
for example, in Long Li'test, there are 8 NVMe drives involved.

When IRQ flood is detected, we reserve a bit little time for providing
chance to make softirq/threads scheduled by scheduler, then the above
problem can be avoided.

When we moving the interrupt handling into irq thread, other softirq/
threaded interrupt/thread gets chance to be scheduled, so we can avoid
to stall the whole system.

For NVMe or any multi-queue storage, the default scheduler is 'none',
which basically does nothing except for submitting IO asap.
