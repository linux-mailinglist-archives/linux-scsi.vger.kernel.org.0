Hi Damien,

Thanks again for the detailed reply. Your replies are very informative 
and help me understand the context better.

However, I'm still less than enthusiast about the introduction of the 
I/O priority class IOPRIO_CLASS_DL. To me command duration limits (CDL) 
is a mechanism that is supported by one storage standard (SCSI) and of 
which it is not sure that it will be integrated in other storage 
standards (NVMe, ...). Isn't the purpose of the block layer to provide 
an interface that is independent of the specifics of a single storage 
standard? This is why I'm in favor of letting the ATA core translate one 
of the existing I/O priority classes into a CDL instead of introducing a 
new I/O priority class (IOPRIO_CLASS_DL) in the block layer.

Others may have a different opinion.

Thanks,

Bart.
