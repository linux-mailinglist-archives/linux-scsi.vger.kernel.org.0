That looks doable, we may steal bios from the old in-queue request, then
re-submit them via generic_make_request(), and finally free the old request,
but RQF_DONTPREP has to be addressed via one new callback.

So follows the overall solution for waiting request vs. CPU hotplug,
which is done
in two stages:

1) in the teardown callback of new  CPUHP state of CPUHP_BLK_MQ_PREP,
which is run before CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_IDLE,  at that time the CPU & managed
IRQ is still alive:

- stopped the hctx
- wait in-flight requests from this hctx until all are completed

2) in the teardown callback of CPUHP_BLK_MQ_DEAD, which is run
after the CPU is dead

- dequeue request queued in sw queue or scheduler queue from this hctx
- steal bios from the dequeued request, and re-submit them via
generic_make_request()
- free the dequeued request, and need to free driver resource via new
callback for
RQF_DONTPREP, looks only SCSI needs it.
- restart this hctx


Thanks,
Ming Lei
