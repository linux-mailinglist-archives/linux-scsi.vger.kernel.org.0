OK, but I still have concern with this. That's your choice.

But that feature will only work for the queues which you expose. For the 
low-latency queues, there would be no draining*. However, the 
low-latency interrupts are not managed; as such, I think that their 
interrupts would migrate when their cpumask goes offline, rather than 
being shutdown, so not vulnerable to this problem.

* In principle, since you can submit the scsi request on different hw 
queue than expected from blk-mq perspective, when we offline the cpu 
which blk-mq set to submit on, blk-mq may actually wait for requests to 
complete on these low-latency queues and addition to the HW queue which 
blk-mq thought that the request would be submitted on - again, not 
ideal, and may cause problems.

Thanks,
John
