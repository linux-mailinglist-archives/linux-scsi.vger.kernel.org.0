Oh well, this is the source of confusion here. I didn't (also the patch) claim
that the link up will happen with higher speed. It will most likely fail if it
couldn't operate at the higher speed and that's why we need to limit it to lower
gear/mode *before* bringing the link up.

As you can see, the driver patch is parsing the limits in its
ufs_hba_variant_ops::init() callback, which gets called during
ufshcd_hba_init().
