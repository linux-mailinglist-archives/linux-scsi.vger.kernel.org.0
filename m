           Summary: LEDs are off for AHCI connected drives on Cisco C125

Attaching the support config logs.

Observed that on linux OS the LED of the drives are completely off (both
Presence and Locate LED) for the AHCI connected drives on the Cisco UCS C125
server.

Note : - Tried on Rhel7.7 OS and Sles 12 SP4 OS, on both LEDs were off, but on
Rhel7.7 OS provided  "libahci.ahci_em_messages=0" in the grub after with which
LED worked on the Rhel7.7, but on SLes 12SP4 and other linux distributions not
able to pass the "libahci.ahci_em_messages=0" ,and LED of the drives are not
blowing.


Tested with latest upstream kernel of version
"kernel-debug-5.4.11-1.1.g2d02eb4.x86_64.rpm" then also issue is persisting.

Expected Behavior: 
The LED of the drives should work even on Linux OSes.

Attached the support config logs with this bug.
