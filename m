We can reliably trigger the issue with a certain load pattern on a certain hardware.

I've compiled 6eb045e092ef  and got (as with other affected kernels) "controller is offline: status code 0x6100c" after 15 minutes of the test load.
I've compiled 6eb045e092ef^ and the load is running for 3 1/2 hours now.

So you hit it.

I'm not into this and can't comment on that. But if you need me to test any patch for verification, I'll certainly can do that.
