To me that looks like hiding the problem rather than fixing it.

For example, Rafael's revert was a real issue that we uncovered.

From a maintenance point of view, hiding problems rather than
fixing them, creates an unsustainable technical debt for the
future.

Then it would be a core PM issue not a UFS issue.

I'll look into it, but maybe the following would help:
