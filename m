Quick test: After those two lines were commented out from the Makefile, 
the compiler still knew to rebuild unusual-tables.o and uas.o when 
usb-ids.c and usb-ids-uas.c were changed.  So these lines aren't needed.

Apart from this, I tried running the patch through checkpatch.pl, and it 
flagged a bunch of issues.  Some of them were false positives, but 
others really should be changed to match the kernel's style:

	The SPDX license line in .c files is supposed to be a
	C++-style comment, i.e., use // instead of /* ... */.

	We aren't supposed to add new typedefs.  Instead of writing:

		typedef enum {...} dev_type;

	write:

		enum dev_type {...};

	and the same for dev_flags_set.

	checkpatch would like the FLAGS_END macro value to be enclosed
	in parentheses, since it's a complex expression.  Same for the 
	HI32 macro.  These don't really matter, but you may as well do
	it just to get rid of the warnings.

	Quoted strings (line 117 in mkflags.c) aren't supposed to be
	broken across lines.  It should just be one very long line.

	Contrariwise, some other lines are longer than checkpatch likes 
	to see (its maximum is 100 columns).  They should be wrapped.

These issues ought to be fixed.  But it's all stylistic stuff; I don't 
see any actual errors or things to improve in the patch.
