Thanks for the clarification.

The problem with what Ming is proposing in my mind (and its an existing
problem that exists today), is that nvme is taking precedence over
anything else until it absolutely cannot hog the cpu in hardirq.

In the thread Ming referenced a case where today if the cpu core has a
net softirq activity it cannot make forward progress. So with Ming's
suggestion, net softirq will eventually make progress, but it creates an
inherent fairness issue. Who said that nvme completions should come
faster then the net rx/tx or another I/O device (or hrtimers or sched
events...)?

As much as I'd like nvme to complete as soon as possible, I might have
other activities in the system that are as important if not more. So
I don't think we can solve this with something that is not cooperative
or fair with the rest of the system.

I see, so it still seems that irq_poll_softirq is still not efficient in
reaping completions. reaping the completions on its own is pretty much
the same in hard and soft irq, so its really the scheduling part that is
creating the overhead (which does not exist in hard irq).

Question:
when you test with without the patch (completions are coming in 
hard-irq), do the fio threads that run on the cpu cores that are 
assigned to the cores that are handling interrupts get substantially lower
throughput than the rest of the fio threads? I would expect that
the fio threads that are running on the first 32 cores to get very low
iops (overpowered by the nvme interrupts) and the rest doing much more
given that nvme has almost no limits to how much time it can spend on
processing completions.

If need_resched() is causing us to context switch too aggressively, does 
changing that to local_softirq_pending() make things better?

Although, this can potentially cause other threads from making forward
progress.. If it is better, perhaps we also need a time limit as well.

Perhaps we should add statistics/tracing on how many completions we are
reaping per invocation...
