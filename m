As a new solution, how about do both of these:
a. Add a per-IOMMU group sysfs file to set this tunable. Works same as 
how we change the default domain, and has all the same 
restrictions/steps. I think that this is what you are already suggesting.
b. Provide a DMA mapping API to set this value, similar to this current 
series. In the IOMMU backend for that API, we record a new range value 
and return -EPROBE_DEFER when successful. In the reprobe we reset the 
default domain for the devices' IOMMU group, with the IOVA domain rcache 
range configured as previously requested. Again, allocating the new 
default domain is similar to how we change default domain type today.
This means that we don't play with a live domain. Downside is that we 
need to defer the probe.

Thanks,
John
