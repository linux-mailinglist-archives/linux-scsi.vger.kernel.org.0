There are too many changes that help increasing bio size, so it's not 
possible to pick one or a few patches.

Yes, splitting bios at the driver helps.

Folios also help with using larger bio size.

Databases should use direct I/O and with direct I/O, they can generate as 
big bios as they want.

Note, that if a database uses buffered block device, performance will be 
suboptimal, because the buffering mechanism can't create large bios, it 
only sends page-sized bios. But that is expected to not be used - the 
database should either use a block device with direct I/O or a filesystem 
with or without direct I/O.

I suggest to use some real-world workload - you can use something that you 
already use to verify the performance of RHEL.

The problem with fio is that it generates I/O at random locations, so 
there is no bio merging possible, so it will show just the IOPS value of 
the underlying storage device.
