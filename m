Subject: [PATCH 6/9] lpfc: Remove unnecessary lockdep_assert_held calls

In an audit of lockdep calls in the driver, there are multiple lockdep
checks in successive calling layers. E.g. a routine checks, and then
calls a lower routine that also checks, and so on. Calling sequences
result in many redundant checks.

Refine the code to remove lower-level lockdep checks.
Update comments on the lock, correcting a few places where lock object
in comment was incorrect.
