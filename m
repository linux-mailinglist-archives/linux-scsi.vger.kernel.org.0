I doubt this is true as it has been already thought as unnecessary
in Linux:

I doubt that is true as genirq is running understand the consumption
that hardIRQ is running in irq-disabled context:
"We run all handlers with interrupts disabled and expect them not to
enable them. Warn when we catch one who does."
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b738a50a

If it is, m68k is against the assumption of genirq.
