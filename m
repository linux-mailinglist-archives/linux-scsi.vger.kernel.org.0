These patches are based on Martin Petersen's 5.18/scsi-queue tree
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mkp/scsi.git
  5.18/scsi-queue

This set of changes consist of:
 * Correcting a stack trace when the driver is unloaded. The driver was
   holding a spin lock when calling scsi_remove_device. 
 * Adding in new PCI device IDs and aligning the device order with our
   out-of-box driver. No functional changes.
 * Allow NCQ to be enabled for SATA disks. The controller firmware has
   to have support for this feature.
 * Enhance reboot performance by now issuing disk spin-downs during
   reboots. This eliminates spin-up time required doing the boot up.
 * Speed up multipath failover detection by returning DID_NO_CONNECT
   when the controller returns a path failure. Previously, the driver was
   waiting on an internal re-scan to detect the path failure.
 * Change function name pqi_is_io_high_priority() to
   pqi_is_io_high_priority() for better readability. Remove some white
   spaces from the same function.
 * Correct the structure used for AIO command submission. The structure
   used was pqi_raid_path_request, but needs to be pqi_aio_path_request.
   Both structure are the same size and have the same member offsets,
   so no issues were reported.
 * A PQI_HZ MACRO was introduced some time ago to resolve some timing
   issues. This definition is not needed. Switch back to using HZ.
 * For certain controllers, there was a request to avoid a drive
   spin-down for suspend (S3) state transitions.
 * For small drive expansions, the driver was not detecting the new
   size changes. We added a rescan whenever the driver receives an
   event from the controller.
 * In some rare cases, the controller can be locked up when a kdump
   is requested. When this occurs, the kdump is failed. This helps
   in debugging the cause of the lockup.
 * For RAID 10 disks, only one set of disks were used for read
   operations. Now we spread out I/O to all volumes. This resolves
   some inconsistent performance issues.
 * Export SAS addresses for all disks instead of only SAS disks.
 * Correct NUMA node association during pci_probe. A small typo
   was causing a different NUMA node to be set.
 * Not all structures were checked with BUILD_BUG_ON.
 * Correct some rare Hibernate/Suspend issues. Newer controllers
   may boot up with different timings.
 * Correct WWID output for lsscsi -t. The wrong part of the 16-byte WWID
   was used for the SAS address field.
 * Bump the driver version to 2.1.14-035
