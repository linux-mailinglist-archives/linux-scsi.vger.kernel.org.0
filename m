And ATA (ACS) too. Not just SCSI. This is actually an improvement over IO
priority (command priority) that is supported only by ATA NCQ and does not
exist with SCSI/SBC.

We discussed CDL with Hannes in the context of NVMe over fabrics. Their
may be interesting extensions to consider for NVMe in that context (the
value for local PCI attached NVMe drive is more limited at best).

I would argue that IO priority is the same: that is not supported by all
device classes either, and for those that support it, the semantic is not
identical (ATA vs NVMe). Yet, we have the RT class that maps to high
priority for ATA, and nothing else as far as I know.

CDL at least covers SCSI *and* ATA, and as mentioned above, could be used
by NVMe-of host drivers to do fancy link selection for a multipath setup
based on the link speed for instance.

We could overload the RT class with a mapping to CDL feature on scsi and
ata, but I think this is more confusing/messy than a separate class as we
implemented.
