Right, so I think maybe we can take a step back. Instead of depending on 
explicit new ioctl which may cause a lot of issues, can we do something 
similar to vhost_vq_is_setup().

That means, let's create/destory new workers on SET_VRING_ADDR?

I think SET_BACKEND is sufficient for net.

For vsock (and scsi as well), their backend is per virtqueue, but the 
actual issue is there's no uAPI to configure it per vq. The current uAPI 
is per device.

Yes, so if we really want one w(which is still questionable during our 
discussion). We can start from a SCSI specific one (or an alias of vDPA 
one).

That seems to pre-allocate all workers. If we don't care the resources 
(127 workers) consumption it could be fine.

If I read the code correctly, for modern device, guest will set 
queue_enable for the queues that it wants to use. So in this ideal case, 
qemu can forward them to VRING_ENABLE and reset VRING_ENABLE during 
device reset.

But it would be complicated to support legacy device and qemu.

I think it's device reset, the semantic is that unless the queue is 
enabled, we should treat it as disabled.

Right, my original idea is to try to make queue_enable (in the spec) 
work for SCSI and we can use that for any delayed stuffs (vq, or workers).

But it looks not as easy as I imaged.

Thanks
