Hi Vinod,

What do you mean by the reset is invoked twice?

Renaming 'rst' to something else equals disabling this patch.

You said 845 has not this problem, I thought you tested the patch on 845 
with
the same 'rst' defined on 8998 and 8150. If 'rst' is not present in 
845's DT,
it means this patch has no impact on 845.

Actually, in our code base, we are not using phy-qcom-qmp.c. Instead,
we are using phy-qcom-ufs.c. phy-qcom-ufs.c is the one we use in all of 
our
mobile projects. Although both have the same functionality,
but in phy-qcom-ufs.c, the PCS ready bit polling timeout is 1000000us,
while in phy-qcom-qmp.c the PCS ready bit polling timeout is 1000us.
Would you mind give below change a try?

FYI, I tried the opposite change on my board (decrease the PCS polling 
timeout
used in phy-qcom-ufs.c), I did see PCS polling timeout, which is the 
same failure
you encountered.

On 845, if there is 'rst'

Thanks.
