Not quite.
I think multipath should make the decision, and we shouldn't try to 
out-guess multipathing from the device driver.
We should only make the information available (to wit: the path state) 
for multipath to make the decision.
But if multipath decides to send I/O via a path which we _think_ it's in 
transitioning we shouldn't be arguing with that (ie we shouldn't preempt 
is from prep_fn) but rather let it rip; who knows, maybe there was a 
reason for that.

The only thing this patch changes (for any current setup) is that we'll 
incur additional round-trip times for I/O being sent in between the 
first I/O returning with 'transitioning' and multipath picking up the 
new path state. This I/O will be returned more-or-less immediately by 
the target, so really we're only having an additional round-trip latency 
for each I/O during that time. This is at most in the milliseconds 
range, so I guess we can live with that.

If, however, multipath fails to pick up the 'transitioning' state then 
this won't work, and we indeed will incur a regression. But that 
arguably is an issue with multipath ...

Cheers,

Hannes
