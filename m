Right, we should not be hiding HW queues from blk-mq like this. This 
breaks the symmetry. Maybe we can move this functionality to blk-mq, but 
I doubt that this is a common use case.

Any examples or references for this?

I thought that this driver/or mpt3sas already used a polling mode.

And for these low-latency queues, I figure that the issue is not just 
polling vs interrupt, but indeed how fast the HW queue can consume SQEs. 
A HW queue may only be able to consume at a limited rate - that's why we 
segregate.

As an aside, that is actually an issue for blk-mq. For 1 to many HW 
queue-to-CPU mapping, limiting many CPUs a single queue can limit IOPs 
since HW queues can only consume at a limited rate.
