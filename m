The "breaking" change is that the dev_ref_clk_ctrl registers are now identified
by name instead of assumed to be index 1.

A reviewer had complained about the device-mapper bindings of this driver before
(https://lkml.kernel.org/r/158334171487.7173.5606223900174949177@swboyd.mtv.corp.google.com).
Changing to identifying the registers by name seemed like an improvement.

If needed I can add a hole at index 1 to make the DTS changes work with
old/stable kernels too, but I didn't know that is a requirement.  (Normally for
Linux kernel development, kernel-internal refactoring is always allowed
upstream.)  If I do this, would this hack have to be carried forever, or would
we be able to fix it up eventually?  Is there any deprecation period for DTS, or
do the latest DTS have to work with a 20 year old kernel?
