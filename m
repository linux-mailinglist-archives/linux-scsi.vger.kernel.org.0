The data book for the NCR53FC94/NCR53FC96 (the 'fast' SCSI controller 
used on the board Kars tried) states that with the features enable bit 
clear (no 24 bit DMA counts used), zero does mean 64k indeed. The 
features enable bit is never set by esp_scsi.c. I chose the incorrect 
length limit without realizing this special case for the transfer count. 
and before we found out that 1-byte DMA just won't work.

I need to confirm this from a data book of the older (pre-fast) 
revisions of this chip family. but since as Kars also states, the core 
driver default for the 16 bit transfer size is 64k as well, I very much 
suspect the same behaviour for the older revisions.

All of the old board-specific drivers used a max transfer length of 
0x1000000, only the fastlane driver used 0xfffc. That lower limit might 
be due to a DMA limitation on the fastlane board. We could accommodate 
the different limit for this board by using a board-specific 
dma_length_limit() callback...

For the benefit of keeping the code simple, and avoid retesting the 
fastlane board, that might indeed be the better solution.
