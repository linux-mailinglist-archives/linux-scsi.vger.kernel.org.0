Thing is, fc_block_scsi_eh() is assumed to be called from eh callbacks
_before_ any TMFs are to be sent.
Typically you would call them in eh_device_reset() or eh_target_reset()
to ensure that you can sent TMFs in the first place; no point in attempting
to send TMFs is the port is blocked.

Your particular case is arguably a mis-use of fc_block_scsi_eh() as
it is called _after_ host reset is initiated, essentially serving as
a completion point to ensure that all rports are back online.

However, for the FC transport implementation rport lifetimes are
decoupled from SCSI Host lifetimes; rports may (and do!) come and
go during the lifetime of a SCSI host. Consequently there is no
difference between a host with all rports blocked (eg during RSCN
processing) and a host just coming on-line after SCSI EH where rports
are still in the process of getting ready.

Hence the use of fc_block_scsi_eh() after host reset is not required,
and we can make our life easier by just dropping the call.

Ah, right. True, when the rports are not ready (ie still being blocked)
sending a TEST UNIT READY will fail, with probably unintended consequences.

But: if host reset would return FAST_IO_FAIL everything would be dandy
as then we would just check if the devices are online (by virtue of
scsi_eh_flush_done_q() in scsi_unjam_host()), which they really should
as no-one should have set them offline by then.

So I guess that's the correct way to go.
Will be modifying the patch accordingly.

Thanks for the feedback!

Cheers,

Hannes
