That's pretty much what James was suggesting, except for one thing: You 
must not set sdkp->device->expecting_media_change to 1 for all devices 
in sd_runtime_resume().  Only for devices which may generate a spurious 
Unit Attention following runtime resume -- and maybe not even for all of 
them, depending on what the user wants.
