Sorry, there was something wrong with the previous process description.
the correct is:

1. REVALIDATING DOMAIN
2. new device attached, create port,etc.
4. done REVALIDATING DOMAIN
5. @out, handle parent->port->sas_port_del_list
6. sas_probe_devices()
7. if device probe failed in step 6 and call 
sas_unregister_devs_sas_addr(), then add phy->port->list to 
parent->port->sas_port_del_list // port won't delete

8. next, REVALIDATING DOMAIN
9. new device attached
10. new port create failed, as port already exits.


So, v3 delete port at then end of sas_probe_devices(). And if we don't 
use sas_unregister_devs_sas_addr() follow your suggestion then we don't 
need to call sas_destruct_ports().
Thanks,
Xingui
