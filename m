We can most likely move that VERIFY to after revalidation. That should shorten
delays on first access after resume as many drive do actually spinup with the
reset done before revalidating (but note that the specs say that even a reset
shall not take a drive out of standby mode, without specifying the reset type,
so this is rather loosely defined).

In theory, yes, that was the intent. In practice, the verify was issued from
scsi PM resume context while the actual drive port reset + revalidation is done
in libata EH context, triggered from ATA port resume context which itself was
not synchronized/ordered with the scsi disk resume. So we ended up with the
verify command execution sometimes being attempted with the drive not even
revalidated yet, or with the port/link not even active sometimes (depending on
timing). So problems all over and deadlocks due to scsi revalidate using the
device lock, which PM use too.

See above. With the switch to async PM ops in scsi in kernel 5.16, things broke
badly due to the lack of synchronization that sync PM provided before that.

ACS defines that only media access commands can get a drive out of standby mode
back into active mode. So an IDENTIFY command would not (normally) spinup a
drive. Nor would READ LOG. Normally, IDENTIFY, READ LOG etc done in revalidate
can be processed with the drive spun down (*but* I have seen drives that react
badly to some of these commands when spun down). Hence why I put it first,
before revalidate. Now that all the synchronization is in place and libata EH
does its own manage_start_stop for system suspend/resume, I will see if moving
the verify to the end of revalidate works.
