From: Xiang Chen <chenxiang66@hisilicon.com>

Currently the Hisilicon SAS controller v3 hw driver supports runtime PM.
However a number of corner-case bugs have been reported for this feature.
These includes:
a. If a directly-attached disk is removed when the host is suspended, a
system hang may occur during resuming. Libsas drains events after resuming
the host. Draining the events causes a deadlock as we need to ensure that
the host is resumed for some libsas events processing, however the resume
process will not complete until all events are processed;
b. If a disk is attached to an expander when the host is suspended then 
this new disk will not be detected when active again;
c. The host controller may not be resumed from suspension when sending 
SMP IOs;
d. If a phy comes up when resuming the host controller then we may get a
deadlock from processing of events DISCE_DISCOVER_DOMAIN and 
PORTE_BYTES_DMAED;
e. Similar to d., the work of PORTE_BROADCAST_RCVD and PORTE_BYTES_DMAED
may deadlock.

This series addresses those issues, briefly described as follows:
a. As far as we can see, this drain is unneeded, so conditionally remove it
in patch 1~2;
b. Just insert broadcast events to revalidate the topology in patch 4~7;
c. and e. When processing any events from the LLD, make libsas keep the
host active until finished processing all works related to the original
events in patch 9 and 14;
d. Defer phyup event processing in case described in patch 10~12;


Change Log:
v1 -> v2:
- Rewrite those commit messages according to John Garry's suggestions;
- Add my SOB for patch 2 and change SOB of John Garry's to Acked-by 
in patch 8 and 15;
