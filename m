My argument wasn't so much about scsi_eh_lock_door() (which will be sent 
only in rare cases), but rather scsi_eh_try_stu() and scsi_eh_tur() as 
invoked from scsi_eh_test_devices() at the end of each SCSI EH step.
Both of which would need similar treatment.

Plus one maybe should revisit scsi_end_request(); that does refer to

	struct request_queue *q = sdev->request_queue;

despite having a 'struct request' as argument; maybe one should modify 
that to

	struct request_queue *q = req->q;

to not start accounting on the wrong queue.

Cheers,

Hannes
