I fully agree. The 'no tag' scenario should never happen with libsas 
with this patchset.
But for that to happen we need to:
- Ensure that even ATA devices on libsas always have a domain device (I 
think it's true nowadays, but we'll need to check).
- Add a host port to libsas, such that sas_alloc_target() will have a 
valid target/port upon lookup (and your patch won't be needed anymore)
- Move ATA non-SCSI commands over to using sas slow tasks. This 
shouldn't be much of a problem as really the only non-SCSI ATA command 
which will need to be sent from within an I/O stream is the 'read log'
command, and that is handled internally by the drivers anyway.
All other commands are sent during device discovery or from out-of-band 
things like ioctl, so they should be fine using slow tasks.

Cheers,

Hannes
