It's not only lookup, it's iteration in general.
Which affects scanning and device removal; especially the latter is 
_very_ error prone (just look at scsi_target_reap etc), so any reduction 
in complexity is a good thing in general methinks.

I would assume that we're seeing benefits as soon as we're in the range 
of tens to hundreds of devices; then list lookup will be eating up more 
time and space as xarrays.

And the big benefit of using xarrays is that we will be alerted if an 
element with the same indices is being added; we've already had issues 
in the past here which are notoriously difficult to track down.

Cheers,

Hannes
