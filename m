Yes, I think consistent behaviour would be good. I suppose we just need 
the same check to reject QD of > 32 in ata_change_queue_depth() (and not 
just cap to 32 there).

Having said all that, scsi_device_max_queue_depth() does introduce some 
capping. But let's just consider SATA behaviour now.

It's up to you. Obviously we are making an improvement in this series, 
but if we are going to backport then it's better to backport something 
fully working first time.

Thanks,
