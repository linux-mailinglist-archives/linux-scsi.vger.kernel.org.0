 From the original discussion I gather Areca sometimes acts as a 
pass-through device to actual storage hardware, so it may well have been 
decided for the firmware to take a conservative approach and interpret 
the low order byte only.  A genuine bug cannot be ruled out either of 
course, which I why I will appreciate your testing.

 FWIW if all else fails you can try this patch with the original kernel 
you used with the box.  This piece of code hasn't changed, so until I 
came up with the complete five-part solution proposed here I merely had 
the original commit reverted as it is so as to allow forward progress.

 In any case, as per the cover letter, I have upgraded from 2.6.18, much 
older, and this was the sole show-stopper for the machine, running SMP 
even, so chances are 5.11+ will work with your system as well.  The 
other plain 486/EISA/ATA box, similarly upgraded (now that I got its 
faulty odd industrial PSU finally replaced) works just fine with vanilla 
5.11.

 OTOH versions ~3.15 through to ~4.5 I have tried while bisecting this 
issue mostly failed to even start booting due to what looks like a 
heisenbug to me (e.g. switching from XZ to gzip for compression would 
make some, but not all versions/configurations boot occasionally), so 
YMMV.

 Overall we're not that bad with keeping stuff working, it's more new 
use that causes troubles sometimes.

 And here it's masking, except that with (256 - 1) rather than (512 - 1) 
as you suggested.

 Thank you for your input!
