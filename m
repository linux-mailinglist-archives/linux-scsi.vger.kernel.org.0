If that is your preference, I have no problem with changing it. I wasn't
thrilled with either location.

I originally wrote a version which worked this way, but discarded it out
of concern that there may be tape software which expects the current
behavior and uses some of the ioctls as an overly clever method to
flush the buffer. The flush behavior has been there a long time so I was
concerned about completely removing it and risking breaking some
other application.

Perhaps my paranoia about changing the behavior is unwarranted. Do
you think it best to completely ignore any flushing or buffering for these
IDing ioctls?

st_ioctl is quite the mess with how things are laid out. I can see
about making a version which moves the handling of generic scsi
ioctls into its own function instead of adding to st_ioctl's complexity.

Thanks,
