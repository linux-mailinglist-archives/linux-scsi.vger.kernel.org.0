I don't doubt your results.  But you need to do a better job of 
explaining how the existing code leads to those results.

For example, you said the driver does not set the command's residue 
when the command succeeds.  But in fact, one of the first things 
usb_stor_invoke_transport() does -- before it begins transmitting the 
command -- is

	scsi_set_resid(srb, 0);

So if the command is successful, even if the transport layer routine 
doesn't set the residue explicitly, the value should still be 0.

So if you see the residue not getting set properly, you should explain 
exactly how that happens.

But the residue gets reset to 0 every time before the command is
retried, doesn't it?

Unless for your device, the driver doesn't run 
usb_stor_invoke_transport().  The only way that can happen is if you 
use one of the modular subdrivers -- in which case the bug lies in that 
subdriver and should be fixed there, not in transport.c.

But usb_stor_Bulk_transport() calls usb_stor_bulk_srb(), which does set
the residue, as you realize:

Please investigate a little more closely into what's going wrong and
present more details so that others can understand it too.
