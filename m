There is one more thing that I find strange in the driver and that may
cause problems: tag 0 is a perfectly valid tag value that can be
returned by pm8001_tag_alloc() since find_first_zero_bit() will return 0
if the first bit is 0. And yet, there are many places in the driver that
treat !tag as an error. Extremely weird, if not outright broken...

I patched that and tested and everything seems OK... Could it be that
you are not seeing some completions because of that ?

I added the patch to my v3. Will send Monday.
