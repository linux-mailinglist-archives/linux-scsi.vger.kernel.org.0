[I corrected Martin’s email from peterson to peters*e*n. Don, you should 
have also receive a bounce message from the MTA. I guess Martin has 
these as a list subscriber nevertheless, but I suggest to resend the 
series as soon as possible.]

Dear Don,


Thank you for your reply.

Only because a customer complained? That is not a good enough reason in 
my opinion. Log messages, often grepped for, are an interface which 
should only be changed with caution.

If these absent feature message were present for a long time, and you 
suddenly remove them, people looking a newer Linux kernel messages, 
users conclude the feature is supported now. That is quite a downside in 
my opinion.

That’s why you should develop for Linux master branch and upstream 
*first* to get external reviews. That argument should not count for 
Linux upstream reviews in my opinion.


Kind regards,

Paul
