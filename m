Hmm... May be there was nothing to sync: hdparm -y putting the drive in standby
mode should have synced the write cache already and the FS issued sync may have
ended up not causing any media write, as long as the FS did not issue any new
write (which would have spun up the drive). The specs are clear about this:

In STANDBY IMMEDIATE description:

Processing a STANDBY IMMEDIATE command shall cause the device to prepare for a
power cycle (e.g., flush volatile write cache) prior to returning command
completion.

So this is all does not seem that strange to me.

Some random access from user space, e.g. systemd doing its perodic "something"
with passthrough commands ?

Same user space in that case ?

Then as mentioned above, nothing may be written, which results in the drive not
waking up since the write cache is clean already (synced already before spin down).

Not sure. But it may be a write FUA vs actual sync. With runtime pm, any command
issued to the disk while it is suspended will cause a call to pm runtime resume
which issues a verify command to spinup the drive, regardless if the command
issued by the user needs the drive to spin up. So that is normal. With hdparm
-y, the driver thinks the drive is running and so does not issue that verify
command to the drive. The drive spinning up or not then depends on the command
being issued and the drive state (and also likely the drive model and FW
implementation... Some may be more intelligent than others in this area).

Given your description, that is my thinking exactly. The problem here for the
second part (spinning up the disk for "useless" commands) is that determining if
a command needs the drive to spinup or not is not an easy thing to do, and
potentially dangerous if mishandled. One possible micro optimization would be to
ignore flush commands to suspended disks. But not sure that is a high win change
beside *may be* avoiding a spinup on system suspend witha drive already runtime
suspended.
