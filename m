Here is how the commit affect the flow:

When the command finished with status set to 1, and the actual
finished byte is less than requested.

Before this commit, scsi_io_completion_nz_result would check
result like following:
if (status_byte(result) && scsi_status_is_good(result)) {
        result = 0;
        *blk_statp = BLK_STS_OK;
}
If the lowest byte of result is 1, the status_byte() returned false,
the result would not be updated. So scsi_io_completion_nz_result()
returned a non zero value. We would call scsi_io_completion_action()
to handle this command after scsi_end_request() failed.

In scsi_io_completion_action(), the command should be finished
with BLK_STS_IOERR, while it is finished with BLK_STS_OK.

After this commit, scsi_io_completion_nz_result would check
result like following:
if (result & 0xff && scsi_status_is_good(result)) {
        result = 0;
        *blk_statp = BLK_STS_OK;
}
Where result && 0xff is 1, the result would be 0, and
scsi_io_completion_nz_result() returned 0. We would call
scsi_mq_requeue_cmd() to requeue this command after
scsi_end_request() failed.
