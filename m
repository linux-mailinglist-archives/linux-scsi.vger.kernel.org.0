Me too, so I confirmed the result by executing the code snippets.

Here's a truth table for v2:

qpair fw_started fcport deleted result
---------------------------------------
F       X       F       X       -ENODEV
F       F       T       F       -ENODEV
F       F       T       T       -EBUSY  *
F       T       T       F       -ENODEV
F       T       T       T       -EBUSY  *
T       F       F       X       -EBUSY  *
T       F       T       X       -EBUSY
T       T       F       X       -ENODEV
T       T       T       F       neither
T       T       T       T       -EBUSY

Here's a truth table for v3:

qpair fw_started fcport deleted result
---------------------------------------
F       X       F       X       -ENODEV
F       F       T       F       -ENODEV
F       F       T       T       -ENODEV *
F       T       T       F       -ENODEV
F       T       T       T       -ENODEV *
T       F       F       X       -ENODEV *
T       F       T       X       -EBUSY
T       T       F       X       -ENODEV
T       T       T       F       neither
T       T       T       T       -EBUSY

The asterisks mark the changed rows.

I don't know whether the changes in v3 are desirable or not, I was just 
pointing out that the commit log ("valid qpair but the firmware has not 
yet started return EBUSY") now seems to disagree with the code.
