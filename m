That is a very good question.  I went back to reproduce the deadlock again, and it is because, in addition, ufshcd_state is UFSHCD_STATE_EH_SCHEDULED_FATAL.  So I have updated the commit message accordingly in V3.

As has been noted, that commit introduces several new deadlocks - and will presumably cause the deadlock this patches addresses, even if ufshcd_state is not UFSHCD_STATE_EH_SCHEDULED_FATAL.

It is perhaps more appropriate to revert "scsi: ufs: Synchronize SCSI and UFS error handling" for v5.15 and try to get things sorted out for v5.16.  What do you think?
