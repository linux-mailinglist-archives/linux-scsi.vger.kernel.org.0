It only makes what the user requested via num_queues.

That patch will:
1. For the default case of num_queues=1 we use the single worker created 
from the SET_OWNER ioctl.
2. If num_queues > 1, then it creates a worker thread per num_queue > 1.

I was thinking more you want an event like when a device/LUN is 
added/removed to a host. Instead of kicking off a device scan, you could 
call the block helper to remap queues. It would then not be too invasive 
to running IO. I'll look into reset some more.

Ah ok. I I'll look into that some more. A funny thing is that I was 
trying to test that a while ago, but it wasn't helpful. I'm guessing it 
didn't work because it didn't implement what you wanted for disable 
right now :)
