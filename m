Not exactly, sorry that I didn't put it clearly. There are cases where 
cmds
are completed with an error (either OCS is not SUCCESS or device returns
check condition in resp) and accompanied by fatal or non-fatal UIC 
errors
(UIC errors invoke UFS error handler). For example, SSU is completed 
with
OCS_MISMATCH_RESPONSE_UPIU_SIZE (whatever the reason is in HW), then 
auto
hibern8 enter (AH8 timer timeout hba->ahit is set to a very low value) 
kicks
start right after but fails with fatal UIC errors. From dmesg log, these 
all
happen at once. I've seen even more complicated cases where all kinds of 
errors
mess up together.

To me, task abort to PM requests does not worth being treated so 
differently,
after all suspend/resume may fail due to any kinds of UFS errors (as 
I've
explained so many times). My idea is to let PM requests fast fail (60 
seconds
has passed, a broken device maybe, we have reason to fail it since it is 
just
a passthrough req) and schedule UFS error handler, UFS error handler 
shall
proceed after suspend/resume fails out then start to recover everything 
in a
safe environment. Is this way not working?

Thanks,

Can Guo.
