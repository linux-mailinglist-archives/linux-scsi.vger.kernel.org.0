Hi Eric/Gaurav,

Adding more information and some questions to this discussion,

Just bit of history afaiu.

on Qcom SoCs there are 3 ways to talk to Trusted service/Trusted 
application.

1> Adding SCM calls. This is not scalable solution, imagine we keep 
adding new scm calls and static services to the TZ as required and this 
is going to bloat up the tz image size. Not only that, new SoCs would 
need to maintain backward compatibility, which is not going to happen. 
AFAIU this is discouraged in general and Qcom at some point in time will 
move away from this..

2> using QSEECOM: This has some scalable issues, which is now replaced 
with smcinvoke.

3> smcinvoke: This is preferred way to talk to any QTEE service or 
application. The issue is that this is based on some downstream UAPI 
which is not upstream ready yet.

IMO, adding a solution that is just going to live for few years is 
questionable for upstream.

Fixing [3] seems to be much scalable solution along with it we will also 
get support for this feature in all the Qualcomm platforms.

Am interested to hear what Gaurav has to say on this.
