Yes. The refcnt must be 1 for rmmod to work. If it is not it will fail.

That's the thing, the trace on comment #1 does not exactly show who to blam=
e,
but there seems to be only two possibilities: systemd and multipath. Regard=
less
what is clearer is that once the device is exposed we *cannot* block usersp=
ace
from poking at the device. The best we can do, is udevadm settle, however t=
hat
still does not guarantee userspace things like multipath won't try to poke.

Yes! try_module_get() would fail if rmmod was kicked off.

This may work actually, and so new users who would want to avoid this race
would have to issue this call prior to rmmod. That would remove the possibi=
lity
of a race. Let me know if you have a patch I can test. Putting this as
re-opened.
