Great!  You can test this with fscrypt, a.k.a. ext4 or f2fs encryption.

A basic manual test would be:

1. Build a kernel with:

	CONFIG_BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION=y
	CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION=y
	CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION_INLINE_CRYPT=y

2. Create a filesystem with 'mkfs.ext4 -O encrypt' or 'mkfs.f2fs -O encrypt'

3. Mount the filesystem with '-o inlinecrypt'

4. Create an encrypted directory and copy some files into it.

5. Unmount the filesystem, and mount it *without* '-o inlinecrypt'.

6. Verify that the files match the originals.

If you're using a Linux distro like Debian, then creating an encrypted directory
is most easily done using the userspace tool https://github.com/google/fscrypt.

If instead your testing platform is Android, then instead of the above manual
test you can configure Android's encryption use the hardware and then run
VtsKernelEncryptionTest.  See the directions at
https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based.

Note that this patchset only includes the device tree support for Snapdragon
845.  For 855 and 865 you'd need to add the device tree support.

There are other ways this can be tested too, like xfstests, or my experimental
blk-crypto-selftest.  Let me know if you want any other suggestions.

(Please trim your replies appropriately; I almost missed this part!)

No, that's not necessary because this function is only called if we installed a
blk_keyslot_manager to the UFS host (thus exposing its crypto support to the
rest of the kernel).  We only do that if the driver sets UFSHCD_CAP_CRYPTO.

Likewise, we don't need to check for UFSHCD_CAP_CRYPTO in
ufshcd_crypto_keyslot_program(), ufshcd_crypto_keyslot_evict(), etc.
