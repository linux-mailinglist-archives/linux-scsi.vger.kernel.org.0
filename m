Most of the stuff there is slow moving data, typically set once at device
creation time. The design predates atomic bitops. I can't see why the
addition of an extra bitfield, whose overwriting is not going to cause
a calamity ***, warrants the proposer having the rewrite this patch.

Doug Gilbert


*** setting offline_already effectively invalidates a lot of other bitfields.
     Still, if the offline_already fails to be set, due to a clash
     (with what?), then at worst the warning message is repeated and the
     patch code tries again to set that bitfield.
