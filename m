This lock is defined for single EQ/RQ. For multi EQ/RQ which we will add 
in future, will have more granular locks and performance improvements.
All the State Machine Events are triggered from the EQ processing thread 
except vport creation and deletion.

Locking:
   Global lock per efc port "efc->lock"

Domain:
     efc_domain_cb --> (All the events are executed under efc lock)

     Async link up notification(EFC_HW_DOMAIN_FOUND)
          Alloc Domain, Start discovery
          Alloc Sport
     Async link down notification (EFC_HW_DOMAIN_LOST)
           Hold frames. (New frames will be moved to pending)
           Post Sport Shutdown.
           Post All Nodes Shutdown.

Sport:
     efc_lport_cb --> (All the events are executed under efc lock)

       HW sport registration (Mbox command responses) to complete sport 
allocation.

Vport :
     efc_sport_vport_new() --> New Vport

      efc_vport_sport_alloc() (Protected by efc lock)
      Alloc Sport, and start Sport SM

    efc_sport_vport_del()  --> Delete Vport

      Post shutdown event to the Sport. (Protected by efc lock)

Node:
    efc_remote_node_cb() --> (All the events are executed under efc lock)

        HW node registration (Mbox command responses) to complete node 
allocation.

Node lifeCycle:
    efc_domain_dispatch_frame:-

     EFC lock held
     efc_node_find() IF not found, Create one.
     when PLOGI is received, Register with hardware
     Upon PRLI completion, setup a new session with LIO.

    IO path:

      Find sport and node under EFC lock.
      If node can process commands, start IO processing.
      Each IO is added to the node->active_ios.

   Node deletion: (RSCN notification or LOGO received ..)

      EFC lock held
      Disable receiving fcp commands. (node->fcp_enabled)
      Disable IO allocation for this node.
      Remove LIO session.
      Deregister node with HW
      Waits for all active_ios to be completed/freed.
      Purge pending IOs.
      Free the Node.

In IO path, EFC lock is acquired to find the sport and node, release the 
EFC lock and continue with IO allocation and processing. Note: There is 
still an unsafe area where we check for 'node->hold_frames" without the 
lock. Node is assumed to be kept alive until all the IOs under the node 
are freed.  Adding the refcounting will remove this assumption.
