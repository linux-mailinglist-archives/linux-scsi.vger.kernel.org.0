What should the sd driver do when it gets the error in the subject
line? Try again, and again, and again, and again ...?

sd 2:0:1:0: [sdb] Unaligned partial completion (resid=3584, sector_sz=4096)
sd 2:0:1:0: [sdb] tag#407 CDB: Read(16) 88 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00

Not very productive, IMO. Perhaps, after say 3 retries getting the _same_
resid, it might rescan that disk. There is a big hint in the logged
data shown above: trying to READ 1 block (sector_sz=4096) and getting a
resid of 3584. So it got back 512 bytes (again and again ...). The disk
isn't mounted so perhaps it is being prepared. And maybe that preparation
involved a MODE SELECT which changed the LB size in its block descriptor,
prior to a FORMAT UNIT.


Another issue with that error message: what does "unaligned" mean in
this context? Surely it is superfluous and "Partial completion" is
more accurate (unless the resid is negative).
