Hello Mike
Against linux-next with some manual fixups (as expected) 

The original issue I reported for tcm_loop seems to be resolved with
this series of patches as well as the stall if memory became low.
I also rans some additional tcm_core tests on a target server with
tcm_qla2xxx as it uses some of the tcm_core changes.
Its not exhaustive
for all changes but covers most.
