By moving this chunk here(from iscsi_target_do_login_rx to 
iscsi_target_do_tx_login_io), we have already
restore sock callbacks(like below in iscsi_target_do_login),
So clearing READ_ACTIVE would not cause another delayed
work being scheduled.

So I think we would not have the race you pointed out
for last login pdu.

[code snippet

iscsi_target_do_login()
...
login->login_complete = 1;
iscsi_target_restore_sock_callbacks(conn);
if (iscsi_target_do_tx_login_io(conn,
                           login) < 0)

...
]

Even if we move above chunk here, I realize that we
could still theoretically have problem.

For login pdus which is not initial or last login pdus,
after enable scheduling delayed work by clearing READ_ACTIVE.
It is possible to queue a delayed work. (i.e. a out of order
initiator could send pdus at any time).
In case we received such out of order pdu, we need
to cancel them when we have an error and later
doing the clean up.

I will try to solve this and resend these patches.
Maybe it's better to cancel_delayed_work() in
iscsi_target_do_login_rx.

I might not express myself very clear. Please
see next version of these patch.

Your comments make sense and are helpful for me. Thanks.
