Lets see if anything happens. Applied as sg3_utils revision 1019 and
pushed to https://github.com/doug-gilbert/sg3_utils .

Didn't see any effect on an Ubuntu 22.10 when sg3_utils deb package
built and installed. No sign of 00-scsi-sg3_config.rules being placed
anywhere by Ubuntu. Does Suse install those rules?
