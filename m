Yes. I was trying to allow queuing the delayed work early.

For the last login pdu, we may have race as you said. thanks for 
pointing it out.

I was trying to image a case where we can hit the race, normally it is 
case a).

a). initiator send last login pdu -> target received -> target replied

b). initiator send last login pdu -> target received -> initiator send 
something -> target replied

in case b). we will queue another delayed work which we should not.  
After the target replied

the last login pdu, conn->conn_login is freed. we might visited it in 
the delayed work.

I am not very sure if we could or if it is good to cancel_delayed_work 
from the work itself.

If it is ok then i am ok with it. Or in another way, I think we could 
just clear

LOGIN_FLAGS_READ_ACTIVE and set LOGIN_FLAGS_WRITE_ACTIVE

after iscsi_target_restore_sock_callbacks when finish process last login 
pdu.

What do you think?



Thanks,
