Another potential way of doing this might be to transmit the buffer
information as a separate scatterlist, a bit like DIF/DIX.  At the
bottom of the stack, the write buffer has to complete before the
dependent command so we could actually enforce that right at the driver
level using the same tag since the two commands are sequential.
