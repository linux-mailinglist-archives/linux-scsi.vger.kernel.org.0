Hi all again,

Bart,

In my setup I use QLE2560 as target (it has lower WWPN) and one port of
QLE2742 as initiator. The proposed fix doesn't work for me. The same
PLOGI error is returned.

When target is started with qlini_mode=dual, the connection is
initialized in AL_PA topology. FW assigns AL_PA for both ports. It sets
AL_PA ef for the target port and e8 for initiator on my setup.

LOOP DOWN event comes right after then target is created and existing
rport is deleted by initiator without explicit LOGO and N_Port handle
cleanup.

Then the topology changes to N2N, the session is getting re-initialized,
but initiator doesn't set correct D_ID for PLOGI, because FW returns
wrong port id for initiator (ef instead of e8) in the response of Get ID
mailbox command.

Quinn, Himanshu, does it tell something to you?

Thank you,
