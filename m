I understand that changing the block device name does not matter
between reboots.
But as I understood in these cases, the order of HCTL (Host: Channel:
Target: Lun) for devices is changed. Unfortunately, I did not capture
the order of HCTL before the failure and I can't provide evidence. But
if I rely on my brain, then I know that the order of the HCTL before
the failure was different in all the cases presented.
This is indirectly confirmed by how the state of the pool in zfs is
demonstrated. And it seems that it depends on how the device was added
(by scsi-id or by wwn-id).
By scsi-id (when there were messages in the dmesg about device
changes), the failure was shown as follows:
---
# zpool status
  pool: pool
 state: UNAVAIL
status: One or more devices are faulted in response to IO failures.
action: Make sure the affected devices are connected, then run 'zpool clear=
'.
   see: http://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-HC

errors: 51 data errors, use '-v' for a list
---
Than in normal state zpool status show:
---
# zpool status
  pool: pool
 state: ONLINE
  scan: scrub repaired 0 in 1h39m with 0 errors on Sun Oct  8 02:03:34 2017

errors: No known data errors
---

And in another case, when the LUN is imported by wwn-id (and now any
errors in dmesg) in error state, zpool status is:
---
# zpool status
  pool: pool1
 state: ONLINE
  scan: scrub repaired 0B in 17h30m with 0 errors on Sun Apr 14 17:54:55 20=
19
config:

pool1                                     ONLINE       0     0     0
  sdc                                     ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors
---
In the status there are no errors, but show block device name from /dev/
Than in normal state zpool status show wwn-id from /dev/disk/by-id
instead of device name from /dev:
---
root@lpr11a:~# zpool status
  pool: pool1
 state: ONLINE
  scan: scrub repaired 0B in 17h30m with 0 errors on Sun Apr 14 17:54:55 20=
19
config:

NAME                                      STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
pool1                                     ONLINE       0     0     0
  wwn-0x600144f0b49c14d100005b7af8ee001c  ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors
---

P.S. I would also like to note /dev/disk is not reflect reality - SSD
are not disks.
