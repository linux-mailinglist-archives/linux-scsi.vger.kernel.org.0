To have to add code in libata that touches the scsi device PM status is what's
not going to be great. Such code should stay in sd.c and scsi_pm.c. But not sure
we actually need anything.

With my tests, I never set the ata port power/control to "auto", which may be
why I did not see the port being runtime suspended when the scsi disk was
runtime suspended. Will try again.

With the device links in place between port and scsi devices, we should be OK.
But still need to check that we do not need runtime_get/put calls added.
Ideally, we should have the chain:

scsi disk -> scsi target -> scsi host -> ata port

for runtime suspend, and the reverse for runtime resume. If there is a system
suspend/resume between runtime suspend/resume, the port should not be resumed if
it is runtime suspended.
