The point is that expecting_media_change should apply only to the _next_ 
command.  It should be cleared after _every_ command.  You do not want 
to leave it hanging around -- if you do then you will miss real media 
changes.

There's a potential issue when a bunch of commands get sent and 
completed all at once, but hopefully it won't matter here.
