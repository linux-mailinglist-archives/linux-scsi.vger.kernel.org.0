And while being true in general, it does make some assumptions:
- Reserved commands will never being sent via the block layer
- None of the drivers will need to use the additional 'scsi_cmnd' payload.

Here I'm not sure if this is true in general.
While it doesn't seem to be necessary to send reserved commands via the 
block layer (ie calling 'queue_rq' on them), we shouldn't exclude the 
possibility.
Didn't we speak about that in the context of converting libata?

And I have some driver conversions queued (fnic in particular), which 
encapsulate everything into a scsi command.

That's what Bart suggested a while back, but then we have to problem 
that the reserved tags are completed with the same interrupt routine, 
and _that_ currently assumes that everything is a scsi command.
Trying to fix up that assumption would mean to audit the midlayer 
(scmd->device is a particular common pattern), _and_ all drivers wanting 
to make use of reserved commands.
For me that's too high an risk to introduce errors; audits are always 
painful and error-prone.

Having looked at the block layer and how tags are allocated I found it 
too deeply interlinked with the request queue and requests in general.
Plus I've suggested that with a previous patchset, which got vetoed by 
Bart as he couldn't use such an API for UFS.

And, indeed, not possible when we will need to send these requests 
during error handling, where the queue might be blocked/frozen/quiesced 
precisely because we are in error handling ...

Allocating a bio is a relatively trivial task. But as soon as we ever 
want to be able to implement polling support for reserved tags we 
essentially _have_ to use requests, and that means we'll have to use the 
provided interfaces from the block layer.
