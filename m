Thank you for continuing to work on this!

According to your cover letter, this feature requires a custom TrustZone im=
age to work on SM8550.  Will that image be made available outside Qualcomm?
--> Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to do that. You can still r=
equest for one through our customer engineering team like before.

Also according to your cover letter, this feature will work on SM8650 out o=
f the box.  That's great to hear.  However, SM8650 does not appear to be pu=
blicly available yet or have any upstream kernel support.  Do you know appr=
oximately when a SM8650 development board will become available to the gene=
ral public?
--> I meant it will be available in the future releases. As of today, I don=
't have any information on the timelines

Also, can you please make available a git branch somewhere that contains yo=
ur patchset?  It sounds like this depends on https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm=
/fs/fscrypt/linux.git/log/?h=3Dwrapped-keys-v7, but actually a version of i=
t that you've rebased, which I don't have access to.
Without being able to apply your patchset, I can't properly review it.
--> As for the fscrypt patches,
      I have not changed much functionally from the v7 patch, just merge co=
nflicts.
      I will update this thread once I figure out a git location.

Thanks!

- Eric
