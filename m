I agree there is only so much we can do especially when IO's have been
dispatched to hardware queues. I think if anything happens to those,
too bad, these ones will incur an abort or status check as well. These
would just need to be identified and subsequent IO's then sent to a
different path but that is a different topic. 

My primary concern is that if anything happens on a lun that changes
its attributes or access characteristics a UA should be sent in order
to inform a host. It cannot be that an array shuffles a lun id onto a
different physical volume without the host knowing. This will for sure
cause data corruption.
