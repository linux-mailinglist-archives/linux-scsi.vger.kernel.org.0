Maybe try enabling PM debug messages ? That could tell us what is going on.

Spinning up the disk on resume is needed as many drives require the disk to=
 be
spun up to reply to commands, and that even applies to commands that do not
access the media (e.g. IDENTIFY, READ LOG, etc). The reason is that many dr=
ives
save their meta-data on a reserved area of the media (the spinning disk).

So even if the kernel were to explicitly defer spinning up the disk, the di=
sk
itself would in many instances automatically spinup, and that would manifest
itself with a long delay to the reply to the initial IDENTIFY command issued
during the rescan initiated by resume. And delaying that rescan is also not
desired as that would force the PM code to report "OK, this device is resum=
ed
and ready" while it is in fact not ready at all to receive commands. So the
"tour de force" is really not desired at all in practice.

You likely can avoid the hdd spinup on resume by soft-removing the device
before suspend. Then we could add a libata option to ignore some ports on
resume so that they are not probed. But then, reusing the drive after resume
will require a manual rescan for the disk to show up again. And all of this
also assumes that there is no file system mounted on the disk, of course.

Given that most laptop these days do not use HDDs anymore, I do not think a=
ll
of this is worth the effort.
