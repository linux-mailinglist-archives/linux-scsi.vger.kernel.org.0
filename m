Seen from a pass-through perspective, the resid is just about the near-end
data transfer between the HBA and pass-through, or as cam3r03 says:

− cam_resid;
     The data residual length member contains the difference in twos complement
     form of the number of data bytes transferred by the HA for the SCSI
     command compared with the number of bytes requested by the CCB
     cam_dxfer_len member. This is calculated by the total number of bytes
     requested to be transferred by the CCB minus the actual number of bytes
     transferred by the HA.

[where "HA" is HBA (or the initiator)]

That makes overflow (negative resid) a bit interesting as it is only
reasonable that the pass-though user allocated a buffer big enough to
receive dxfer_len bytes. One would hope that in the READ case of overflow,
the HBA would have sent the residual bytes to the bit bucket (i.e.
/dev/null) rather than overfill the data buffer provided by the pass-through.

Handling discrepancies between page length (e.g. of VPD, LOG and MODE pages)
and the ALLOCATION LENGTH field are defined in the SCSI standards.

That leaves the difficult cases: when there is a discrepancy between what the
SCSI command (and the storage device) implied as a data length and the
dxfer_len allocated at the near-end. In some, but not all, cases that is
detectable before the command is issued.

Overflow can happen, for example if the RDPROTECT field in a READ(10) is
accidentally set (e.g. because it uses bits previously used for a SPI
LUN) and the storage device has protection information. That will result
in an extra 8 bytes per logical block being returned.
