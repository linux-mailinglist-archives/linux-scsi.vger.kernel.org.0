I thought it was called directly from the restart logic via the
device_shutdown() call (see kernel/reboot.c:kernel_restart_prepare())
and was completely independent of any other state transitions within
the device model ... however, I'd really like *you* to confirm this.

I think by the time it's called, we're already in the system death
throes, so if there were going to be an orderly shut down it's already
happened, but if not, once you set a devices state to DEL, it will
defeat any later attempt to do orderly remove of the host or target.

It seems reasonable, but can you validate that?  Shutdown is called
both from reboot and kexec and if we stop IO to a quiescing root device
before it completes, so that all filesystems come back dirty, we'll
have a lot of unhappy users ...
