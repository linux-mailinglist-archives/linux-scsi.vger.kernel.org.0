Not getting it, sorry. :-(

The error handler sets UFSHCD_STATE_RESET and never leaves the state
as UFSHCD_STATE_RESET, so that case does not need to start the error
handler because it is already running.

The error handler is always scheduled after setting 
UFSHCD_STATE_EH_SCHEDULED_FATAL.

scsi_dec_host_busy() is called for any non-zero return value like
SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY:

i.e.
	reason = scsi_dispatch_cmd(cmd);
	if (reason) {
		scsi_set_blocked(cmd, reason);
		ret = BLK_STS_RESOURCE;
		goto out_dec_host_busy;
	}

	return BLK_STS_OK;

out_dec_host_busy:
	scsi_dec_host_busy(shost, cmd);

And that will wake the error handler:

static void scsi_dec_host_busy(struct Scsi_Host *shost, struct scsi_cmnd *cmd)
{
	unsigned long flags;

	rcu_read_lock();
	__clear_bit(SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT, &cmd->state);
	if (unlikely(scsi_host_in_recovery(shost))) {
		spin_lock_irqsave(shost->host_lock, flags);
		if (shost->host_failed || shost->host_eh_scheduled)
			scsi_eh_wakeup(shost);
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(shost->host_lock, flags);
	}
	rcu_read_unlock();
}

Note that scsi_host_queue_ready() won't let any requests through
when scsi_host_in_recovery(), so the potential problem is with
requests that have already been successfully submitted to the
UFS driver but have not completed. The change you suggest
does not help with that.

That seems like another problem with the patch 
"scsi: ufs: Synchronize SCSI and UFS error handling".
