If you want to make AAA and BBB stay in one bi_vec, they should be
continuous in memory (DDR), otherwise they will be put into two
bi_vecs and eventually become two sglist entries. My doubt is that
if user uses different memory areas to contain something as you
said, how can this fix make AAA and BBB stay in one sglist entry?

Thanks,

Can Guo.
