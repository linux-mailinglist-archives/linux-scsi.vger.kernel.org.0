IO size usually depends on workloads, instead of controller.

You can't assume that big size IO is always submitted from userspace
because HBA is high end.

For sequential IO workloads, block layer tries best to run IO merge,
which is usually big win for HDD.

No, there are workloads, single IO size isn't big, but
they are sequential, it may not be hit by readahead, such as
write. That is exactly what block layer has to run IO merge
for these small IOs.

Frankly speaking, we should check NONROT flag instead of controller,
which may connect to slow HDD too, right?
