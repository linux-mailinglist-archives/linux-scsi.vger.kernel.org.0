Well quiet - the principle use-case of virtio-rpmb is to provide a RPMB
like device emulation for things like OPTEE when running under QEMU's
full-system emulation. However when it came to testing it out I went for
Thomas' patches because that was the only virtio FE implementation
available.

When I finished the implementation and Ilias started on the uBoot
front-end for virtio-rpmb. uBoot being firmware could very well be
running in the secure world so would have a valid use case accessing an
RPMB device. We ran into API dissonance because uboot's driver model is
roughly modelled on the kernel so expects to be talking to eMMC devices
which lead to requirements to fake something up to keep the driver
stacks happy.

I guess what we are saying is that real secure monitors should come up
with their own common API for interfacing with RPMB devices without
looking to the Linux kernel for inspiration?
