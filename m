That one should be fixable, though it I do not see an elegant method to do it.
It would be easy with ugly code, e.g. tweaking the scsi device runtime pm state
from libata... Not great.

Never saw that in my tests when enabling runtime pm on the scsi disk only. Which
is the important point here: there is no propagation of the suspend state down
to the device parent it seems.

But there are no runtime PM operations defined for ATA devices, only for ports.
So not sure that matters... I am probably still missing something about runtime
PM and devices ancestry. I focused a lot on system suspend/resume to fix the
issues. runtime suspend/resume is next.

I am not sure of that, especially with cases of ATA ports with multiple disks
(e.g. pmp or IDE).
