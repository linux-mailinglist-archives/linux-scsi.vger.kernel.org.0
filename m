Thanks for looking at this.

The intention is to make the locking easier to understand.  We need either to
share access to the host (e.g. ufshcd_queuecommand) or provide for exclusive
ownership (e.g. ufshcd_err_handler, PM, Shutdown).  We should be able to do
that with 1 rw_semaphore.

You are talking about contention between ufshcd_queuecommand() running
simultaneously on 2 CPUs right?  In that case, down_read() should be practically
atomic, so no contention unless a third process is waiting on down_write()
which never happens under normal circumstances.

It is probably worth measuring the performance of clk_scaling_lock first.
