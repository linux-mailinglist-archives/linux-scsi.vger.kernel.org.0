That was a stupid suggestion on my part. Sorry.

It would be good if someone (Paul?) could verify whether that commit
actually caused the regression they saw.

Looking at that 6eb045e092ef, I notice this hunk:

 
-       busy = atomic_inc_return(&shost->host_busy) - 1;
        if (atomic_read(&shost->host_blocked) > 0) {
-               if (busy)
+               if (scsi_host_busy(shost) > 0)
                        goto starved;

Before 6eb045e092ef, the busy count was incremented with membarrier
before looking at "host_blocked". The new code does this instead:

@ -1403,6 +1400,8 @@ static inline int scsi_host_queue_ready(struct request_queue *q,
                spin_unlock_irq(shost->host_lock);
        }
 
+       __set_bit(SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT, &cmd->state);
+

but it happens *after* the "host_blocked" check. Could that perhaps
have caused the regression?

Thanks
Martin
