So what should we do to prevent unit-value access of sshdr?

1. still init sshdr in __scsi_execute?

@@ -255,6 +255,13 @@ int __scsi_execute(struct scsi_device *sdev, const unsigned char *cmd,
 	struct scsi_request *rq;
 	int ret = DRIVER_ERROR << 24;

+	/*
+	 * Zero-initialize sshdr for those callers that check the *sshdr
+	 * contents even if no sense data is available.
+	 */
+	if (sshdr)
+		memset(sshdr, 0, sizeof(struct scsi_sense_hdr));
+
 	req = blk_get_request(sdev->request_queue,
 			data_direction == DMA_TO_DEVICE ?
 			REQ_OP_SCSI_OUT : REQ_OP_SCSI_IN, BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT);

2. init sshdr in callers of scsi_execute, instead of check the result of scsi_execute and check
whether sshdr is valid? for example:
@@ -506,6 +506,7 @@ int scsi_report_opcode(struct scsi_device *sdev, unsigned char *buffer,
        put_unaligned_be32(len, &cmd[6]);
        memset(buffer, 0, len);

+       memset(&sshdr, 0 ,sizeof(sshdr));
        result = scsi_execute_req(sdev, cmd, DMA_FROM_DEVICE, buffer, len,
                                  &sshdr, 30 * HZ, 3, NULL)

Besides, should sd_pr_command init sshdr?? cause sd_pr_command  have checked the result of scsi_execute 
and check whether sshdr is valid.


3. get rid of DRIVER_* completely? even this, we should init sshdr first. 


sshdr is just 8 bytes, init it does not affect performance

My advice is 2.
