I don't think it would given we'd still move the race elsewhere. It would be
nice design though to do that in principle though. Then load can be done us=
ing
new sysfs knobs. But since we want to keep backward compatibility I can't s=
ee
how this can help.

If try_module_get() fails the module can be in leaving state, that is, its
module removal is being called. But rmmod won't bother to call the unload
module system call unless the refcount is 1.

So, the way to avoid doing things when the module is leaving is to check for
try_module_get(). Other than that, one needs its own state machine. The rac=
es I
observed however likely could not be fixed with a new state machine though,
given the semantics would be the same. I can't see what other information t=
he
driver can get to prevent this race at this time.
