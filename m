And PRE-FETCH has another (sneaky) use. You might think that when a LBA is
unmapped, then if its data is in the cache, it would be removed. So what
does SBC-4 say about reading unmapped LBAs (sbc4r22 4.7.4.4 table 10):
   "user data set to a vendor-specific value that is not obtained from
    any other LBA; and" (... place 0xff bytes in the PI)

Spot the weasel word: _other_ ! So it can read the former data in that
now unmapped LBA. So the second usage of PRE-FETCH is to prevent that.
Even more worryingly, it looks like PRE-FETCH may be needed after a
cryptographic erase (via the SANITIZE command)! SYNCHRONIZE CACHE only
talks about the write side of the cache, not removing stale read data.
