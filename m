Hi Avri

Thanks.

I don't think reverting 1918651f2d7e would fix this.

[   12.182750] ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufshc: ufshcd_suspend: Setting power mode
[   12.190467] ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufshc: wlun_dev_clr_ua: 0 <-- uac wasn't sent
[   12.196735] ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufshc: Sending ssu
[   12.202412] scsi 0:0:0:49488: Queue rpm status b4 ssu: 2 <- sdev_ufs_device queue is suspended
[   12.208613] ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufshc: Wait for resume - <-- deadlock!

The issue is sending any command to any lun which is registered for blk
runtime-pm in ufs host's suspend path would deadlock; since, it'd try to resume
the ufs host in the same suspend calling sequence.
