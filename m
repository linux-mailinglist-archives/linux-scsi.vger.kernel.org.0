Really what I'm interested in is add_disk_randomness(), and the only
caller of that is scsi_end_request(), so I think my question is the
right one.

Interestingly, I _am_ seeing it from hardirq context (if
`in_interrupt()` is to be believed):

[    2.108954]  add_timer_randomness.cold+0x5/0x3a
[    2.110514]  scsi_end_request+0x136/0x1a0
[    2.111903]  scsi_io_completion+0x2e/0x710
[    2.113314]  virtscsi_req_done+0x59/0xa0
[    2.114705]  vring_interrupt+0x46/0x70
[    2.116002]  __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x32/0xb0
[    2.117591]  handle_irq_event+0x2f/0x70
[    2.118929]  handle_edge_irq+0x7c/0x210
[    2.120249]  __common_interrupt+0x33/0x90
[    2.121641]  common_interrupt+0x7b/0xa0
 
And it sounds like you're saying that this is really a softirq function.
So is it correct for me to conclude that the right answer here is that
it can be called from both/multiple contexts, and that's fine and
normal?

Jason
