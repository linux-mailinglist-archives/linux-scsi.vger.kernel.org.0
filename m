Version descriptors used to be updated by Ralph Weber (WDC, T10) but
he stopped doing that about 2 years ago. When that was pointed out
he made a proposal to T10 [20-022r0] for dropping version descriptors
henceforth. The proposal was voted down but no-one has stepped up at
T10 to keep the version descriptors up to date.

Version descriptors used to have an entry on this page:
     https://www.t10.org/lists/1spc-lst.htm
That is no longer the case. They are still in spc6r06.pdf (latest draft)
but haven't been updated for the same period.

I believe Seagate never supported version descriptors. Hitachi/WD
used to support them. But I have a WD SAS disk manufactured last
month and it has no version descriptors.

I have no Toshiba, Samsung nor Kioxia disks. Could someone report if their
recent SAS disks support version descriptors?

Everything else here looks great.

Ah, one thing. If you cache VPD pages (and the standard INQUIRY response),
then if an INQUIRY DATA CHANGED Unit Attention occurs, all the cached data
should be invalidated and the cached VPD pages re-fetched. The Last n Inquiry
Data Changed log page [0xb,0x1] could help with that, but I haven't seen
it implemented yet.
