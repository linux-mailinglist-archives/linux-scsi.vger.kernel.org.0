I don't understand how that could work.  If a device fails to resume 
from runtime suspend, no matter whether the reason is temporary or 
permanent, how can the system use it again?

And if the system can't use it again, what harm is there in pretending 
that the runtime resume succeeded?

I don't think that can be done.  device_del() calls the driver's 
remove routine, which may want to communicate with the device.  If the 
request queue is already in an error state, it won't be able to do so.
