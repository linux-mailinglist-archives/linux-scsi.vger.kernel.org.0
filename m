'xactly.
Especially as we _do_ have error recovery on SCSI, so we should be 
treating a failure to resume just like any other SCSI error; in the end, 
we need to equip SCSI EH to deal with these kind of states anyway.
And we already do, as we're sending 'START STOP UNIT' already to spin up 
drives which are found to be spun down.

So I'm all for always returning 'success' from the 'resume' callback and 
let SCSI EH deal with any eventual fallout.

Cheers,

Hannes
