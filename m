Note that these patches previously went through a number of iterations as part
of the "Inline Encryption Support" patchset (last version was v13:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200514003727.69001-1-satyat@google.com).  There are
no significant changes from v13, right?  It would be helpful to mention this in
the cover letter.

It would also be helpful to describe how this was tested at least in the cover
letter, but maybe in one of the commit messages too.  For example I and two
other people have tested the Qualcomm ICE support on top of this with
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20200501045111.665881-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/.
(BTW, I'll be rebasing, re-testing, and re-sending those patches soon.)
Mediatek has also tested this with
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20200304022101.14165-1-stanley.chu@mediatek.com/.
