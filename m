Right. But that's pretty confusing. Actually, I am confused about some
other things as well.=A0

I apologize for taking a step back and asking some more questions and
presenting some more thoughts about your patch set as a whole.

For passthrough commands, the simplified logic is now:

scsi_decide_disposition()=20
{
         if (!scsi_device_online)
                return SUCCESS;
         if ((rtn =3D scsi_check_passthrough(scmd)) !=3D SCSI_RETURN_NOT_HA=
NDLED)
                return rtn;

         /* handle host byte for regular commands,=A0
            may return SUCESS, NEEDS_RETRY/ADD_TO_MLQUEUE,=A0
            FAILED, fall through, or jump to maybe_retry */

         /* handle status byte for regular commands, likewise */
         =20
 maybe_retry: /* [2] */
         if (scsi_cmd_retry_allowed(scmd) && !scsi_noretry_cmd(scmd))
                return NEEDS_RETRY;
         else
                return SUCCESS;
}

where scsi_noretry_cmd() has special treatment for passthrough commands
in certain cases (DID_TIME_OUT and CHECK_CONDITION).

Because you put the call to scsi_check_passthrough() before the
standard checks, some retries that the mid layer used to do will now
not be done if scsi_check_passthrough() returns SUCCESS. Also,
depending on the list of failures passed with the command, we might
miss the clauses in scsi_decide_disposition() where we previously
returned FAILED (I haven't reviewed the current callers, but at least
in theory it can happen). This will obviously change the runtime
behavior, in ways I wouldn't bet can't be detrimental.

Before your patch set, the checks we now do in scsi_check_passthrough()
were only performed in the case where the "regular command checks"
returned SUCCESS. If we want as little behavior change as possible, the
SUCCESS case is where we should plug in the call to
scsi_check_passthrough(). Or am I missing something? [1]

This way we'd preserve the current semantics of "retries" and "allowed"
which used to relate only to what were the "mid-layer retries" before
your patch set.

The question whether we want an additional limit for the total "failure
retry" count is orthogonal to the above. My personal opinion is that we
do, as almost all call sites that I've seen in your set currently use
just a single retry count for all failures they handle.

I'm not sure whether the separate total retry count would have
practical relevance. I think that in most practical cases we won't have
a mix of standard "ML" retries and multiple different failure cases. I
suppose that in any given situation, it's more likely that there's a
single error condition which repeats.

I'm also unsure whether all this theoretical reasoning of mine warrants
you putting even more effort into this patch set, which has seen 11
revisions already. In general, you have much more experience with SCSI
error handling than I do.

[1] If we did that, we'd could also take into account that previously
the caller would have called scsi_execute_cmd() again, which would have
reset cmd->retries; so we could reset this field if
scsi_check_passthrough() decides to retry the command.

[2] It's weird, although unrelated to your patch set, that in the
maybe_retry clause we increment cmd->retries before checking
scsi_noretry_cmd().
