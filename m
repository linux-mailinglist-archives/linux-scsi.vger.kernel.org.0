Just as a practical matter, I don't think this patchset should be blocked
waiting for a formal Acked-by from every vendor, as some of them don't to be
participating in LKML at all despite being Cc'ed on these patches for a year and
working with us outside LKML to support their hardware using the new framework.
So I think a formal Acked-by on LKML is not always guaranteed.  (It would
certainly be preferable if everyone would participate though!)
