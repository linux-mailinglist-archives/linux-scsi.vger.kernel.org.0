I spent more time thinking about this / testing things.  Probably the
best summary of my thoughts can be found at
<https://crbug.com/1061950#c79>.  The quick summary is that I believe
the problem is that BFQ has faith that when it calls
blk_mq_run_hw_queues() that it will eventually cause BFQ to be called
back at least once to dispatch.  That doesn't always happen due to the
race we're trying to solve here.  If we fix the race / make
blk_mq_run_hw_queues() reliable then I don't think there's a need for
BFQ to implement some type of timeout/retry mechanism.

I prototyped this and I think it would solve the problem (though I
haven't had time to do extensive testing yet).  It certainly makes
BFQ's has_work() more expensive in some cases, but it might be worth
it.  Someone setup to do benchmarking would need to say for sure.

However, I think I've figured out an inexpensive / lightweight
solution that means we can let has_work() be inexact.  It's mostly the
same as this patch but implemented at the blk-mq layer (not the SCSI
layer) and doesn't add a spinlock.  I'll post a v2 and you can see if
you hate it or if it looks OK.  You can find it at:
