queuecommand path should not sleep - that is right, due to queuecommand
can be invoked from contexts where preempt is disabled, e.g. softirq.

I don't know why map_sg() ops can take that long, but apparently it does
not sleep, otherwise we should have seen schedule while atomic error 
long
time ago.

This is the ideal/expected situation, but we are seeing the corner case.

Fixing the root cause of that is one thing, but having the timeout 
handler
back can prevent UFS driver from messing up the subsequent requests 
further
in such case, causing possible data corruption. Is there any drawbacks 
if
we have it back?

Thanks,
Can Guo.
