Agreed, that can be rough.  But as this is an issue that was caused by a
scsi core change, perhaps the scsi developers can describe why it's ok.

But really, device naming has ALWAYS been known to not be
deterministic, which is why Pat and I did all the driver core work 20+
years ago so that you have the ability to properly name your devices in
a way that is deterministic.  Using the kernel name like sda is NOT
using that functionality, so while it has been nice to see that it has
been stable for you for a while, you are playing with fire here and will
get burned one day when the firmware in your devices decide to change
response times.

Any new code adds maintenance overhead and complexity, so you have to
justify it's existance especially when you are not going to be the one
maintaining it :)
