The issue Jason's hinting at is how can admins control the amount
of resources a given qemu instance can consume?
After all vhost vqs all live in host kernel memory ...
Limiting # of open fds would be one way to do that ...

The need to share event/control vqs between devices is a problem though,
and sending lots of ioctls on things like reset is also not that elegant.
Jason, did you have a good solution in mind?

They know about all the fds, for resource control and priveledge
separation reasons.
