We have tried with our patch here and it works. We have not tried with =
our patch at the
customer site where they hit the crash. Since they hit the BUG_ON line =
which we
can see in the logs we have, we expect that removing the race as we did=20=

would avoid the crash. We also remove the BUG_ON=E2=80=99s in our patch =
so it can=E2=80=99t hit
the same crash. If there is another similar race a null pointer =
deference could still
happen in our patch. I saw you had a patch to only use the value if the =
pointer is not
null. That would also work to stop the crash, but it would hide the race =
where the
BUG_ON was helpful in finding it.

Trying our fix at the customer site for us would be more difficult since =
the operating
system crash belongs to Oracle. That is why you see their patch for the =
same
issue. Our interest in getting this fixed goes beyond this customer =
since more
Linux vendors as they move forward in kernel version inherit this code, =
and
we are reliant on ALUA. We hope to catch it here.

Should I put together a patch with the h->sdev set to null removed from =
the
detach function along the syncrhronize_rcu and removing the BUG_ON, or
did you want me to diff against your checkin where you have already =
removed
the BUG_ON?

Thanks,
Brian
