To spin down the drive and put it to sleep.

I am not sure this buys us much. Could try though, but that is a little too much
changes for a bug fix for this cycle.

I think we need to think about that in the context of reworking ata
suspend/resume to be correct with regard to synchronizing ata device and scsi
device suspend/resume with a direct device link, which we do not have right now.

Could look into it, but these bug reports, if any, do not come to me :)
