This is not an issue with the IOVA allocator.

The issue is with how the IOVA code handles caching of IOVAs. 
Specifically, when we DMA unmap, for an IOVA whose length is above a 
fixed threshold, the IOVA is freed, rather than being cached. See 
free_iova_fast().

For performance reasons, I want that threshold increased for my driver 
to avail of the caching of all lengths of IOVA which we may see - 
currently we see IOVAs whose length exceeds that threshold. But it may 
not be good to increase that threshold for everyone.

But that is for a single segment, right? Is there something equivalent 
to tell how many scatter-gather elements which we may generate, like 
scsi_host_template.sg_tablesize?

Thanks,
