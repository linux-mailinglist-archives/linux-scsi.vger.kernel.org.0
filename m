We come with an issue with megaraid_sas driver. Where scsi_cmnd is completed with result's
status byte set to 1, scsi_io_completion() would finish this scsi_cmnd's request with BLK_STS_OK.
The path is:

scsi_io_completion()
	scsi_io_completion_nz_result()
		scsi_status_is_good()	->  return true
		result = 0;
		*blk_statp = BLK_STS_OK
	scsi_end_request() with BLK_STS_OK

While the scsi_cmnd result is actually wrong and should be finished with BLK_STS_IOERR.


What's more, according to code analysis, we found for scsi_cmnd which completed with status byte
undefined in SAM, the scsi_status_is_good() behave differently. For example, if status byte is in
0x1, 0x3, 0x5, 0x9 and so on, it would return true; while for status in other reserved field,
it would return false. 

So I think we should respect the SAM and drop the line "status &= 0xfe" in scsi_status_is_good()
to tell the caller the status is not good for all status which is not defined in SAM, so
scsi_result_to_blk_status() would return BLK_STS_IOERR on this condition.
