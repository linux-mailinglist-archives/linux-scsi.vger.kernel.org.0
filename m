Then why not patch MAINTAINERS, and orphan it, as per usual practice?

$ git log --oneline MAINTAINERS | grep -i orphan

It's not unusual that any Linux driver written more than 5 years ago 
"doesn't appear to have any active users".

If a driver has been orphaned and broken in the past, and no-one stepped 
up to fix it within a reasonable period, removal would make sense. But 
that's not the case here.

I haven't used this driver for a long time, but I still own PowerMacs with 
firewire, and I know I'm not the only one.
