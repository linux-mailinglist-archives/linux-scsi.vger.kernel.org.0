I guess one block device can only bind to one isci connection, given the
1 cmd per connection limit, so looks multiple jobs is fine.

I meant that hctx->run_work is required for blk-mq to dispatch IO, iscsi is
SQ HBA, so there is only single work_struct. If one context is blocked in
->queue_rq or ->queuecommand, other contexts can't submit IO to driver any
more.
