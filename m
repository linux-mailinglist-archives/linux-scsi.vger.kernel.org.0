I do not work in the hard drive industry, so I cannot make assumptions
about all existing models.

All patches should normally undergo further testing and this is no
exception.

I would stress once again that the proposed patch disables write
caching as soon as it realizes that the drive does not support the Sync
Cache command, so it has been designed to be extra safe.

The above is cumbersome, the kernel should support such drives plug and
play, without causing data corruption which is happening at the moment.
