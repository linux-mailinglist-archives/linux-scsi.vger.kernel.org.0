Hi Martin,

An important question is whether it is possible to preserve the write order
all the time. The software layers and hardware components that are involved
in this context are:
* The filesystem.
* The block layer.
* The I/O scheduler if an I/O scheduler is present.
* The SCSI core.
* The SCSI LLD.
* The storage controller (UFSHCI in this case).
* The link between storage controller and storage device.
* The storage device (UFS in this case).

The SCSI protocol allows SCSI devices, including UFS devices, to respond
with a unit attention or the SCSI BUSY status at any time. If multiple write
commands are pending and some of the pending SCSI commands are not executed
because of a unit attention or because of another reason, this causes
command reordering.

The link between UFS controller and UFS device has a low but non-zero BER.
If a SCSI command is lost by this link and has to be resent, this can cause
reordering.

Although I agree that the code in this patch that sorts and resubmits requests
should be triggered infrequently, I don't think that such code can be avoided
entirely. You may have noticed that a significant effort has been undertaken
to eliminate certain causes of command reordering. See also:
* [PATCH v4 0/5] ufs: Do not requeue while ungating the clock
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20230529202640.11883-1-bvanassche@acm.org/).
* [PATCH v6 00/11] mq-deadline: Improve support for zoned block devices
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20230517174230.897144-1-bvanassche@acm.org/)
* less special casing for flush requests v2
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20230519044050.107790-1-hch@lst.de/)

As you may be aware performance matters for UFS devices and performance of UFS
devices increases gradually over time. It is important that the code added by
this patch is triggered infrequently to achieve good performance so I have an
interest myself in making sure that this code is triggered infrequently in
current and also in future kernels.

Since I think that it is not possible to avoid sorting and resubmitting
requests entirely, I propose to proceed with the approach of this patch
series.

Thanks,

Bart.
