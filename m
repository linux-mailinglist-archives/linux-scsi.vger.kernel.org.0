So you are trying to tell me to accept kernel patches today to keep
RHEL9 obsolete systems alive?  And then sometime in the future we can
drop those changes because why?  That feels very wrong and confusing.
What does what gets merged in 2024 have to do with RHEL 9 systems?  You
are free to do whatever you want in your enterprise kernels, don't rely
on making me take broken-by-design code and be forced to maintain it for
the next 10+ years please, that's just not nice.

> Greg, can we please take Chris's patches upstream?

It's a total abuse of the UIO api, and I thought I actually had comments
about it doing it incorrectly as well.  Resend them in the new year
after they have been cleaned up and we can reconsider them then, it's
too late now for anything new for 6.8-rc1 with the holidays apon us now
anyway.

And get the "we want you to take this crud and maintain it for forever
because we have to support an obsolete and out-of-date kernel for paying
customers" story a bit more straight so it doesn't sound so bad :)

thanks,
