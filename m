Hi Alim and Mani,

Here's my take:

There can be multiple reasons for limiting the gear/rate on a customer 
board beyond PHY tuning issues:

1. Board-level signal integrity concerns
2. Channel or reference clock configuration issues
3. Customer board layout not meeting layout design guidelines

This becomes especially critical in automotive platforms like the 
SA8155, as mentioned by Ram. In such safety-critical applications, 
customer prioritize reliability over peak performance, and hence 
customers are generally comfortable operating at lower gears if 
stability is ensured.

For the current case customer had some issue #1 at their end(though 
don't have complete details)

As Mani pointed out, issues are more likely to surface under stress 
conditions rather than during link startup. Therefore, IMHO if any 
limitations are known, it's advisable to restrict the gear/rate during 
initialization to avoid potential problems later.

Moreover, introducing quirks for such cases isn’t very effective, as it 
requires specifying the exact gear/rate to be limited—which can vary 
significantly across different targets.

Regards,
Nitin
