Yes, it is what I was thinking of and I think it looks much better (and
simpler) than coding with different bits. However, I think this is acceptable
only if everyone agrees that combining CDL and lifetime (and potentially other
hints) is not a sensible thing to do. I stated that my thinking is that CDL is
more geared toward rotating media while lifetime is more suitable for solid
state media. But does everyone agree ?

Some have stated interest in CDL in NVMe-oF context, which could imply that
combining CDL and lifetime may be something useful to do in that space...

Getting more opinions about this would be nice. If we do not get any, I would
say that we should go with this.
