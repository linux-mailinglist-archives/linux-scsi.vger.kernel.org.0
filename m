Damien,

what tells you the drive is reporting write cache ? I am not sure about
this...

Consider, we are talking about rather old drives.

I suppose the point is that they were designed with very different
specifications compared to recent drives, surely including the absence
of Synchronize Cache but possibly Write Caching too: the point of
failure is at the Synchronize Cache issuing code, so I patched there.

Whatever the case and as already pointed out, if you are willing to
propose an alternative patch, I will be happy to test it and report
back, as long as the issue is resolved as soon as possible.

Guido
