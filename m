Sure, we'd have to revert the six patches plus the dependent PM fix.

The block bits have been in -next since 7 December, so it has had some
testing.  That said, REQ_PREEMPT doesn't affect much outside of SCSI
and IDE because we're where the original concept of at head insertion
for "special" error handling commands like request sense came from.

I'd expect the biggest field of potential problems to be in USB which
does both block/SCSI and PM.  That should have been well tested by the
PM people (as far as they can, as you know there are tons of non spec
devices out there in the space).

I picked on that because it's the least likely to get any testing for a
while.  However, you're right, there are other potential problem
consumers but hopefully any problem (if there is one) with the rest
will show up quickly.
