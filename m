That doesn't make sense.  Why send commands to the wlun at a time when 
you know the wlun is already suspended?  If you wanted the wlun to 
execute those commands, you should have sent them while the wlun was 
still powered up.

Because you have violated the power management layering.  The platform 
device's suspend routine is meant to assume that all of its child 
devices are already suspended and therefore it must not try to 
communicate with them.

You can't send commands to _any_ device while it is suspended!  That's 
kind of the whole point -- being suspended means the device is in a 
low-power state and therefore is unable to execute commands.

I am not a good person to answer these questions, mainly because I know 
so little about this.  What is the relation between the wlun and the sd 
driver?  For that matter, what does the "w" in "wlun" stand for?

(And for that matter, what do "ufs" and "bsg" stand for?)

You really need to direct these questions to the SCSI maintainers; I am 
not in charge of any of that code.  I can only suggest a couple of 
possibilities.  For instance, you could modify the sd_suspend_runtime 
routine: make it send the commands whenever they are needed.  Or you 
could add a callback pointer to a routine that would send the commands.
