So, looking more closely at this, the code is actually not abusing print_id.

Looking at libata.force in Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt:

[LIBATA] Force configurations.  The format is a comma-
                        separated list of "[ID:]VAL" where ID is PORT[.DEVICE].
                        PORT and DEVICE are decimal numbers matching port, link
                        or device.  Basically, it matches the ATA ID string
                        printed on console by libata.


While this seems a bit fragile, since it relies on the probe ordering
of the SATA controller drivers, which could change, it does still work
as designed after this series:

I added the following to my kernel command line:
"libata.force=5:nolpm"

which yielded:
[    1.811464] ata3.00: FORCE: horkage modified (nolpm)
[    1.811466] ata3.00: LPM support broken, forcing max_power
[    1.811468] ata3.00: ATA-7: QEMU HARDDISK, 2.5+, max UDMA/100
[    1.811470] ata3.00: 2097152 sectors, multi 16: LBA48 NCQ (depth 32)
[    1.811474] ata3.00: applying bridge limits
[    1.811535] ata3.00: LPM support broken, forcing max_power
[    1.811537] ata3.00: configured for UDMA/100

And considering that all checks against ap->print_id is for libata.force
related parameters, I think that we are all good.


Kind regards,
Niklas
