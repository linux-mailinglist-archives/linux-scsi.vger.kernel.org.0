The issue isn't unique to NVMe, and can be any fast devices which
interrupts CPU too frequently, meantime the interrupt/softirq handler may
take a bit much time, then CPU is easy to be lockup by the interrupt/sofirq
handler, especially in case that multiple submission CPUs vs. single
completion CPU.

Some SCSI devices has the same problem too.

Could we consider to add one generic mechanism to cover this kind of
problem?

One approach I thought of is to allocate one backup thread for handling
such interrupt, which can be marked as IRQF_BACKUP_THREAD by drivers. 

Inside do_IRQ(), irqtime is accounted, before calling action->handler(),
check if this CPU has taken too long time for handling IRQ(interrupt or
softirq) and see if this CPU could be lock up. If yes, wakeup the backup
thread to handle the interrupt for avoiding lockup this CPU.

The threaded interrupt framework is there, and this way could be easier
to implement. Meantime most time the handler is run in interrupt context
and we may avoid the performance loss when CPU isn't busy enough.

Any comment on this approach?

Thanks,
Ming
