It is not completely right - wl_suspend/resume() are much more twisted.

wl_suspend() may or may NOT send a SCSI cmd to WLUN, i.e., SSU cmd may
be skipped if spm/rpm_lvl is 0/1 and/or if bkops/wb is on-going (even 
when
rpm_lvl is not 0/1), while link can still be put to hibern8/off, then
power/clks can still be shutdown to save power.

wl_resume(), in case of rpm/spm_lvl == 5, does a full reset to UFS 
device,
without sending a SSU cmd to WLU to complete the power state transition.

So above checks (in scsi_error_handler()) cannot gaurantee that actual
power state transistions in UFS driver has ceased before start UFS error
handling.
