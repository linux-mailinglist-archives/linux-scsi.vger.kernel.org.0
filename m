Checking the code, the dev pm resume call chain for ATA look like this.

ata_port_resume() -> ata_port_request_pm() -> ata_port_schedule_eh() ->
scsi_error_handler() thread runs -> shost->transportt->eh_strategy_handler
=3D=3D ata_scsi_error() -> ata_scsi_port_error_handler() ->
ata_eh_handle_port_resume() -> ap->ops->port_resume() =3D=3D
ahci_port_resume() for AHCI adapters.

There are no commands issued to the device by this chain, only
registers/port settings being changed. So this should always complete
quickly and in itself not be the reason for the START_STOP command issued
by the sd driver to get stuck.

After calling ata_eh_handle_port_resume(), ata_scsi_port_error_handler()
will trigger a reset through ata_std_error_handler() -> ata_do_eh() and
that will cause the device rescan in EH context. Device rescan will
definitely spin up the device so the START_STOP command that sd_resume()
issues seems rather useless...

As a hack, it would be good to try something like this:

I am not sure at all this is correct though. This actually may break other
suspend/resume flavors. If we could somehow synchronize scsi pm resume to
run *after* ata pm resume, all problems should go away I think.
