Note that I copied this text from the original patch authored by someone
at Intel.

I've seen similar claims from people at AMD.

Yes, the HBA can initiate a transition to DevSleep automatically using ALPM,
however, the specs says that:
-DevSleep is disabled by the device on power up (and has to be enabled by a
SET FEATURES command).
-PxDEVSLP.ADSE (Aggressive Device Sleep Enable) for the port is 0 on reset
(the kernel resets the HBA on boot, so ADSE will be disabled for the port).

(DevSleep is never initiated by the device.)

The kernel will only do:
-SET FEATURES to enable the DevSleep feature on the device, and
-Set PxDEVSLP.ADSE to 1

If _all_ of the following are true:
1) SADM and SDS bits are set in the HBA
2) the device reports that it supports DevSleep
3) PxDEVSLP.DSP is set for the port
4) the kernel LPM policy is either ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER or
   ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER_WITH_PARTIAL

See:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.7-rc3/drivers/ata/libahci.c#L2322=
-L2324


This means that if any of 1-5 it not true, the HBA ALPM will never transiti=
on
the device into DevSleep state.

AFAICT, the HBA asserts the DEVSLP signal as long as being in DevSleep stat=
e.

To exit from DevSleep state you can just issue an I/O like normal using PxC=
I,
or write to PxCMD.ICC to force a state change.

I guess you need to ask Intel.

I assume that their firmware simply requires the DEVSLP signal to be
asserted in order to enter lower CPU power states.

If you have a signal, it is easy for the HW logic to detect if the signal
is set or not.

If you just send a command to the device, if it not easy for HW logic
to determine which state is in. It would need to read some registers
or similar. Sounds way more complex than just having a logic gate.


Kind regards,
Niklas
