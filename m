I guess that this is a fallout from commit 6eb045e092ef ("scsi:
  core: avoid host-wide host_busy counter for scsi_mq"). But that commit 
is correct.

If .can_queue is set to (ctrl_info->scsi_ml_can_queue / nr_hw_queues), 
then blk-mq can send each hw queue only (ctrl_info->scsi_ml_can_queue / 
nr_hw_queues) commands, while it should be possible to send 
ctrl_info->scsi_ml_can_queue commands.

I think that this can alternatively be solved by setting .host_tagset flag.

Thanks,
John
