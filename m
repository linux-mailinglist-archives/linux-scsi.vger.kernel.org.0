So are you saying that we can handle it similar to how we now can handle 
changing default domain for an IOMMU group via sysfs? If so, that just 
is not practical here. Reason being that this particular DMA engine 
provides the block device giving / mount point, so if we unbind the 
driver, we lose / mount point.

And I am not sure if the end user would even know how to set such a 
tunable. Or, in this case, why the end user would not want the optimized 
range configured always.

I'd still rather if the device driver could provide info which can be 
used to configure this before or during probing.

Cheers,
John
