yes.

Can,

I did further study and homework on the Linux shutdown in the last few
days. Yes, you are right, usermodehelper_disable() is to prevent
executing the process from the kernel space.

But I didn't reproduce this "maybe" race issue while shutdown. no
matter how I torment my system, once Linux shutdown/halt/reboot starts,
nobody can access the sysfs node. I create 10 processes in the user
space and constantly access UFS sysfs node, also, fio is running in the
background for the normal data read/write. there is a shutdown thread
that will randomly trigger shutdown/halt/reboot. but no race issue
appears.

I don't know if this is a hypothetical issue(the race between shutdown
flow and sysfs node access), it may not really exist in the Linux
envriroment. everytime, the shutdonw flow will be:

e10_sync_handler()->e10_svc()->do_e10_svc()->__do_sys_reboot()-
>kernel_poweroff/kernel_halt()->device_shutdown()->platform_shutdown()-
>ufshcd_platform_shutdown()->ufshcd_shutdown().

I think before going into the kernel shutdown, the userspace cannot
issue new requests anymore. otherwise, this would be a big issue.

pm_runtime_get_sync() will return 0 or failure while shutdown? the
answer is not important now, maybe as you said, it is always 0. But in
my testing, it didn't get there the system has been shutdown. Which
means once shutdonw starts, sysfs node access path cannot reach
pm_runtime_get_sync(). (note, I don't know if sysfs node access thread
has been disabled or not)


Responsibly say, I didn't reproduce this issue on my system (ubuntu),
maybe you are using Android. I am not an expert on this topic, if you
have the best idea on how to reproduce this issue. please please let me
try. appreciate it!!!!!


Thanks,
Bean
