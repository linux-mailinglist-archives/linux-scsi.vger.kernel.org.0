On reflection, there is no reason why the implementation of PRE-FETCH
for a scsi_debug ramdisk can't do what it implies. IOWs get those blocks
into (say) the machine's L3 cache. This is to speed a following
VERIFY(BYTCHK=1) [or NVMe Compare ***] that will use those blocks. The
question is, how?

I have added this to resp_pre_fetch():
    memcpm(ramdisk_ptr, ramdisk_ptr, num_blks*blk_sz);

Will that be optimized out? If so, is there a better/faster way to
encourage a machine to populate its cache?

*** I have a recent WD SN550 SSD whose sequential read speed (after
     data (zeros) written) is around 1200 MB/sec. Its read speed _before_
     data was written was around 25 KB/sec !! And its compare speed
     (with random data written) is a very disappointing 25 MB/sec.
