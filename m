kvm screnshot of failed boot

I have Linux kernel, initrd and grub installed on raid partition, grub manages
to boot kernel fine every time, but then boot freezes on aacraid module init, i
got this lines in dmesg:

aacraid: Host adapter abort request.
aacraid: Outstanding commands on (0, 0, 0, 1)
aacraid: Host adapter abort request.
aacraid: Outstanding commands on (0, 0, 0, 2)
aacraid: Host adapter abort request.
aacraid: Outstanding commands on (0, 0, 0, 3)

They repeat every ~20 seconds. Partitions of raid is not visible for kernel
during this enumeration. I tried to wait, but it seems like it does not change
anything.

Problems can happen after both soft and hard reboots. It happens 50-70% of
boots, so it seems that aacraid driver is not really stable in it's current
state. In rare cases of normal init and boot, I don't have any problems with
driver, it seems to work stable under load for at least weeks.
