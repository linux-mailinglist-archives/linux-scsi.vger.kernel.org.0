Dear Friend,
May the peace of almighty God be with you and your family. I know it
will be a great surprise to you reading this message from me today.
But I want you to consider this as God divine intervention and
opportunity which I believed that You and I can cooperate together in
this humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the merciful
compassionate. This is the second time I am sending the same message
to you, as I urgently need your assistance in this charitable social
project to be established in your country. My names are Mrs. Marina
Bagni Daniels,  a widow diagnosed with brain tumor disease. Please my
dear, I urgently need your sincerity and ability to carry out this
transaction and fulfill my final wish in implementing the charitable
investment project in your country as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure, which i believe that you will not expose
or betray this trust and confident that I'm about to entrust on you.
My late husband made a substantial deposit with the bank with my name
as the beneficiary which I decided to hand over and entrust the sum of
($ 9,650,000.00, Dollars) in the account to you to invest into the
charitable project in your country. Based on my present health status
as I'm permanently indisposed to handle finances or any financial
related project, following my diagnoses. Having known my present
health condition, I decided to seek for your assistance in reclaiming
the fund since I don't have any relation, I decided to donate what I
have to you for the support and mutual benefit of the less privileged,
as I have been touched by God to donate from what I have because it
will be a great loss in spending the fund on my health treatment hence
my doctor has confirmed to me that i will not survive this illness.

This is the reason I contacted you for your support and help to stand
as my rightful beneficiary and claim the money for humanitarian
purposes for the mutual benefits of the less privileged ones. Because
If the money remains unclaimed with the bank after my death, those
greedy bank executives will place the money as an unclaimed Fund and
share it for their selfish and worthless ventures. However I needs
your sincerity and ability to carry out this transaction and fulfill
my final wish in implementing the charitable investment project in
your country as it requires absolute trust and devotion without any
failure and It will be my pleasure to compensate you with part of the
money as my Investment Manager/Partner for your effort in handling the
transaction, while the remaining amount of the money will be invested
into the charity project there in your country. I am waiting for your
prompt response if only you are interested I will give you further
details of the transaction.

God Bless You.
Yours beloved sister in Christ Mrs. Marina Daniels!
