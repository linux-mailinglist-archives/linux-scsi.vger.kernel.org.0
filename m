Hi Ming,

I agree that the scenario above can happen and also that a fix is
needed. However, I do not agree that this should be fixed by modifying
the tag iteration functions. I see scsi_host_complete_all_commands() as
a workaround for broken storage controllers - storage controllers that
do not have a facility for terminating all pending commands. NVMe
controllers can be told to terminate all pending I/O commands by e.g.
deleting all I/O submission queues. Many SCSI controllers also provide a
facility for aborting all pending commands. For SCSI controllers that do
not provide such a facility I propose to fix races like the race
described above in the SCSI LLD instead of modifying the block layer tag
iteration functions.

Thanks,

Bart.
