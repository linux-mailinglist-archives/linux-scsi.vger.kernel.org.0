For standard removable media, I could see issuing an eject before
suspend to emphasize the point.  However, sd cards don't work like that
... they're not ejectable except manually and mostly used as the HDD of
embedded, so the 99% use case is that the user will suspend and resume
the device with the same sdd insert.  It does sound like a use case we
should support.

Can we solve from userspace the case where the user hasn't changed the
media and the resume fails because we don't know?
