OK, so the above isn't actually a deadlock?  I was just assuming that
because 120s seems rather a long time for a SAS scan.  If it actually
eventually returns everything seems to be working correctly ... unless
it's still taking longer than an actual scan would?

Well it alters the behaviour in two ways: firstly because now you're
forced to wait for an entire host scan to complete once you start it,
you can't cancel it as you can today by removing the module; and
secondly it will be a behaviour change:  Today you can call rmmod at
any time until something pins the host either by opening a tape or
mounting a disk at which point delete_modul() fails with -EBUSY.  After
the patch you propose it will also fail with -EBUSY from the moment
scanning starts until the moment it finishes.  I'm not convinced
anything would actually notice either of these, but it is a behaviour
change.
