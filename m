Which is my worry, too.
In the end we're having a massively large array space (128bit if we take 
the numbers as they stand today), of which only a _tiny_ fraction is 
actually allocated.
We can try to reduce the array space by eg. restricting channels and 
targets to be 16 bits, and the LUN to be 32 bits.
But then we'll be having a hard time arguing; "Hey, we have a cool new 
feature, which has a really nice interface, but we can't support the 
same set of devices as we have now...".
That surely will go down well.

Maybe one should look at using an rbtree directly; _that_ could be made 
to work with an 128bit index, and lookup should be fast, too.
Let's see.

Seeing that I'm trying to use the existing HCTL number as index it's 
quite hard to have a per-host lookup structure, as this would inevitably
require a separate LUN index somewhere.
Which would mean to have a two-level xarray structure, where the first 
xarray hold the scsi targets, and the second one the LUNs per target.
Not super-nice, but doable.

Still thinking about the rbtree idea, though.

Cheers,
