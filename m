If extra latency is added in IO completion path, this latency will be
introduced in the submission path, because the hw queue depth is fixed,
which is often small. Especially in case of multiple submission vs.
single(shared) completion, the whole hw queue tags can be exhausted
easily. 

I guess no such effect for networking IO.

The above may be one reason.
