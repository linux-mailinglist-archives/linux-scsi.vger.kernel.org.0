Subject: [PATCH 0/1] Allow non-root users to perform ZBC commands

The source of this issue is that a group is configured that allows a service 
user to perform read and writes to a specific set of disks, and the permissions 
on the sd device entries for a host managed device have permissions 0660, same 
as the sg device entry. Operations succeed on the sg device (since there is
a different code path for handling those operations). 

There was some hand wringing around adding CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities to that 
user, since it includes things like /dev/mem access which was not desired or 
required to perform disk write operations. 

Example failure:
root@device_with_zbc_disks:~# su -s /bin/bash -c 'sg_rep_zones -vv /dev/sdh -m 128' USER_LOW_PERMS
open /dev/sdh with flags=0x802
    Report zones cdb: 95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 00 00
ioctl(SG_IO v3) failed: Operation not permitted (errno=1)

    Report zones cdb: 95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 00 00

Example with patch:
root@device_with_zbc_disks:~# su -s /bin/bash -c 'sg_rep_zones -vv /dev/sdh -m 128' USER_LOW_PERMS
open /dev/sdh with flags=0x802
    Report zones cdb: 95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 00 00
