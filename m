Yeah, even I thoght it was awkward as I couldn't find a way or a 
existing
API to fix it subtly without changing block layer. I was trying not to
make noise to block layer as I am not an expert of it, so I chose the 
akward
way to keep the fix within driver layer. Anyways, thanks for the change 
and
I will come back after I test it.
