The WB pre-request and the READ IO should have been issued in single
command with same tag.

If they can't be done in single command, this sw/hw interface is really bad,
one way is to follow Jens's suggestion to reserve one tag for guaranteeing
forward progress, something like the following:

ufshpb_issue_pre_req()

        req = blk_get_request(cmd->device->request_queue,
                              REQ_OP_DRV_OUT | REQ_SYNC, BLK_MQ_REQ_NOWAIT);
        if (IS_ERR(req)) {
        	req = blk_get_request(cmd->device->request_queue,
                              REQ_OP_DRV_OUT | REQ_SYNC, BLK_MQ_REQ_NOWAIT | BLK_MQ_REQ_RESERVED);
			if (IS_ERR(req))
                return -EAGAIN;
		}

But the above isn't what Christoph complained:

	The HPB support added this merge window is fundanetally flawed as it
	uses blk_insert_cloned_request to insert a cloned request onto the same
	queue as the one that the original request came from, leading to all
	kinds of issues in blk-mq accounting (in addition to this API being
	a special case for dm-mpath that should not see other users).

IMO, accounting seems fine since block layer always counts driver
private request.


thanks,
Ming
