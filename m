I think many devices rely on the fact that they are identified by
Vendor/model/serial_nr, because in most professional SAN storage systems you
can pre-set the serial number to a custom value; so if you want a new disk
(maybe a snapshot) to be compatible with the old one, just assign the same
serial number. I guess that's the idea behind.
