I'll check. That code snippet is copied from NVMe which has equivalent
code: moving storage data to/from _kernel_ buffers. Later in the driver
rewrite, bios are re-used, so if any earlier path puts a different
value in biop->bi_end_io, I'm screwed without that line. So I assumed
the NVMe code did it for a good reason.

See below.

I don't understand this question.

NO, it absolutely does not mean that! With indirect IO (i.e. the default) there
are two transfers, taking a READ operation is an example:
    1) transfer user data from the device (a LU) to the internal buffer allocated
       by the sg driver. LLD arranges that transfer.
    2) transfer that user data from the internal buffer to the user space as
       indicated by the call to ioctl(SG_IO) or its alternatives. This transfer
       is driven by the sg driver using copy_to_user().

The SG_FLAG_NO_DXFER flag skips step 2) _not_ 1) .

The SG_FLAG_NO_DXFER flag has been in the sg driver since 1998. Sometime between
2010 and now that functionality was quietly dropped. Tony Battersby for one
seemed quite peeved when I told him that functionality had been silently
dropped.

Why have the SG_FLAG_NO_DXFER flag?
   - originally to test read speed; no need to allocate and manage a user
     space buffer that isn't going to be used
   - force a RAID to properly check the validity of user data, especially
     if one doesn't trust the VERIFY command which can cheat and simply
     say: "Looks good, next"
   - on mirrored disks: full READ on primary, NO_DXFER READ on secondary;
     checks secondary mirror is in "good order" ***
   - implementation overlaps with mmap()-ed IO in which the "internal buffer"
     is visible to the user space
   - and the big one, for the sg driver rewrite: it is the basis of
     fast copy and compare: that READ internal buffer (a bio) is the perfect
     candidate for the internal buffer of the corresponding WRITE operation,
     both in space and time. In space: one bio for a bound READ and WRITE;
     in time: that WRITE cannot start until the READ completes.

And please RTFM, not just the code. Every time I present this driver I refer
to: https://doug-gilbert.github.io/sg_v40.html and/or the "danny' url. This
from table 2 on the flags field in the v3 and v4 interface:

SG_FLAG_NO_DXFER [0x10000]
SGV4_FLAG_NO_DXFER
With indirect IO, data is "bounced" through a kernel buffer as it passes from 
user space memory to the storage device (or vice versa). This flag instructs the 
driver not to do the portion of the copy between the kernel buffers and user 
memory. There are several cases where this is useful. It is used on WRITE side 
of request sharing because the data to be written is already sitting in that 
kernel buffer (placed there by the preceding READ). Another case is when data is 
mirrored on two disks, it only needs to be actually read back from one of the 
disks, but it may be a good idea to read it back from the other disk at the same 
time to see if a MEDIUM ERROR is reported (which would indicate the mirror is no 
longer safe). If the data is not going to be compared, then the second READ 
could use this flag.

*** I have run the idea of returning a CRC value (T10 algo?) from a NO_DXFER
     READ which is produced from the returned user data. In the mirrored disk
     scenario it would be a way to not only check the secondary was in "good
     order" but that the CRC over the secondary data was the same as the CRC
     over the primary data which has been returned to the user space in full.
     Underwhelming response to date for that idea.
