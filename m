This doesn't look wrong, but these kinds of changes really need to
go along with block layer documentation of the intended uses of the
flags.  In fact the SCSI usage also looks really confused to me and at
very least needs better documentation if not changes.  So I think
you need to do a lot code archaeology, ping the authors and current
maintainers and sort this out as well.

More importantly if the above explanation makes sense we really need
to kill blk_noretry_request off entirely and replace it with a check
of the right set of flags in each caller as well.
