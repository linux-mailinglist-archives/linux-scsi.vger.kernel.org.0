Hi Bart,

Terminating all pending commands can't avoid the issue wrt. request UAF,
so far blk_mq_tagset_wait_completed_request() is used for making sure
that all pending requests are really aborted.

However, blk_mq_wait_for_tag_iter() still may return before
blk_mq_wait_for_tag_iter() is done because blk_mq_wait_for_tag_iter()
supposes all request reference is just done inside bt_tags_iter(),
especially .iter_rwsem and read rcu lock is added in bt_tags_iter().

What I really meant is that .iter_rwsem/read rcu added or blk_mq_wait_for_tag_iter
can't do what is expected.


Thanks,
Ming
