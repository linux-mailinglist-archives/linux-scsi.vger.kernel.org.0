Remember that if the key is ever lost, the RPMB is now completely 
useless forever.

This is why, as far as I know, most sane platforms will use hard fused 
values to derive this kind of thing, not any kind of key stored in 
erasable storage.

Also, newly provisioned keys are sent in plain text, which means that 
any kind of "if the RPMB is blank, take it over" automation equates to 
handing over your key who an attacker who removes the RPMB and replaces 
it with a blank one, and then they can go access anything they want on 
the old RPMB device (assuming the key hasn't changed; and if it has 
changed that's conversely a recipe for data loss if something goes wrong).

I really think trying to automate any kind of "default" usage of an RPMB 
is a terrible idea. It needs to be a conscious decision on a 
per-platform basis.
