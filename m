hmmm..ok, then.

Doesn't this policy really just depend on the host controller driver?

The difference really comes down to the controller programming interface.

For ahci we have a MMIO interface to issue the software reset command.

For my SAS controller of interest, there is no such MMIO interface. To 
issue the reset we build a h2d fis with a SRST set, and send on the 
controller ring buffer like any other IO.

As I mentioned, we can set the SRST for the h2d fis on the HW interface 
without issue, and it works fine. The problem for me is that the command 
comes via libsas/driver, and I would like it to come from libata such 
that it has a ATA queued command associated. But then we have the 
problem that the port is frozen at such times that we want to issue this 
command.

Thanks,
