 The intention here is as you describe. The "needs retry" logic that
comes out of the device handler is inadequate for the multi second
ALUA transition. The "maybe retry" will retry the operation, but those
retries are all exhausted very quickly. So, yes, when the retries are
exhausted and the target is still returning ASYMMETRIC ACCESS STATE
TRANSITION, 04h/0Ah, the path should not be failed since the target is
still within its transition timer in most cases. From my
interpretation of the SPC specification, failing the path so quickly
is incorrect.

After the initial retries are exhausted, the command is re-prepped and
returns to the device handler. I added the 1 second delay so that the
initiator doesn't keep aggressively retrying that path as the
transition state can last for some time. The device_handler will take
care of setting the path state to standby, as you stated above, and an
error is returned should the transition timer expire during this
re-prep looping from its prep_fn. This will satisfy the concern of a
misbehaving target that stays in the transition state too long. If the
transition timer does not fire, which will be the case I would expect
virtually all of the time, the request will succeed or fail once the
port group enters either an active or error state post transition
state.

Thanks,
Brian
