So if there is no plan to remove read/write from sg v3 for root, then I
don't see a need for the new ioctl()s to replace them.

I suppose we could move our codebase to sg v4 eventually.  Right now we
don't need any new features from it, so there is no compelling case to
make the move.  Besides, we are pretty far behind in the kernel version
that we are shipping due to lack of developer time, so it may be a long
time before I can update to a kernel version with these patches anyway.
