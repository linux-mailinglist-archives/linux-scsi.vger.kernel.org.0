This occurs regardless of the CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC setting, and also
with scsi_mod.scan=sync on vendor kernels. All of these disks are coming
from the same driver and card.

I understand that using UUIDs, by-id, etc., is an option to work around
this, but then we would have to push IDs for disks in every server to our
configuration management. It does not seem that this change is really
intentional.
