Waiting for all rports to unblock in host_reset has been on my todo list since 
we prepared the eh callbacks to get rid of scsi_cmnd with v4.18 commits:
674595d8519f ("scsi: zfcp: decouple our scsi_eh callbacks from scsi_cmnd")
42afc6527d43 ("scsi: zfcp: decouple TMFs from scsi_cmnd by using fc_block_rport")
26f5fa9d47c1 ("scsi: zfcp: decouple SCSI setup of TMF from scsi_cmnd")
39abb11aca00 ("scsi: zfcp: decouple FSF request setup of TMF from scsi_cmnd")
e0116c91c7d8 ("scsi: zfcp: split FCP_CMND IU setup between SCSI I/O and TMF again")
266883f2f7d5 ("scsi: zfcp: decouple TMF response handler from scsi_cmnd")
822121186375 ("scsi: zfcp: decouple SCSI traces for scsi_eh / TMF from scsi_cmnd")

But the synchronization is non-trivial as Benjamin's question shows. There are 
also considerations about lock order, etc.

I'm busy with other things, so don't hold your breath until I can review and 
test the code; I don't want any regression in that recovery code.

There is more to do in zfcp than in other FC HBA drivers, e.g. LUN open 
recoveries and how they related to rport unblock:
v4.10 6f2ce1c6af37 ("scsi: zfcp: fix rport unblock race with LUN recovery").
The rport unblock is async to our internal recovery. zfcp_erp_wait() only waits 
for the latter by design.

I don't think so.

> All the other FC drivers do fine without that ...

It would have been nice to have a common interface for all scsi_eh scopes. I.e. 
fc_block_host(struct Scsi_Host*) like we already have for 
fc_block_scsi_eh(struct scsi_cmnd*) and fc_block_rport(struct fc_rport*) [the 
latter having been introduced at the time of above eh callback preparations].
But if zfcp is the only one needing it for host_reset, having the code only in 
zfcp seems fine to me.
