You sure you will need to allocate additional stuff?
The request already comes with the request, scsi, and driver private
bits (ie the additional space from .cmd_size) allocated.

And yes, you can tell in init_cmd_priv() if the command is coming from
the private pool; I had a helper 'req_is_reserved' once, I thought it's
still there ...

Hannes
