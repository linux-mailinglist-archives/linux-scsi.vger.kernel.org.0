I would be really interested in reading or listening to any kind of
summary or parts of the issues.
I'm slightly pushy towards keyctl / keyrings, because it already
provides support for different kinds of key wrapping and key
management. Encrypted keys, trusted keys - those are all kinds of key
management, which either will be missing or will have to be
reimplemented for block layers.

I know that keyrings are clumsy and not that logical, but then their
API needs to be improved. Just ignoring the existing mechanisms sounds
like a bad idea.

I see that dm has at least some provisioning and hooks for
CONFIG_BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION. Thus I thought that it's possible to use
inline encryption through DM.

It's a matter of policy. Harware / firmware doesn't support using both
kinds of keys concurrently, if I understood Gaurav's explanations
correctly. But the user should be able to make a judgement and use
non-hw-wrapped keys if it fits their requirements. The driver should
not make this kind of judgement. Note, this is not an issue of your
original patchset, but it's a driver flaw in this patchset.
