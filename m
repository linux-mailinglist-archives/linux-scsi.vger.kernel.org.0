Why won't an SG device be associated with spraid device nodes? My 
understanding is that an SG device is associated with every SCSI device 
if CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG is enabled and also that a bsg device is associated 
with every SCSI device if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_BSG is enabled.

Why is it that SG_IO is not sufficient? This is something that should 
have been explained in the patch description.

If this rule is not followed, that will be a red flag for the SCSI 
maintainer and something that will probably delay upstream acceptance of 
this patch.
