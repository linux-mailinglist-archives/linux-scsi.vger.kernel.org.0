UAS Log from boot

Hi.=20

Not sure what the benefit of UAS should supposed to be, considering that is
never works, besides breaking things. I have had issues with this using
specific USB Disks with live installers in the past, and now I spent a whole
day debugging boot issues on two servers, caused by UAS on a specific USB/S=
ata
adapter.=20

https://superuser.com/questions/1693125/boot-loop-with-certain-sata-to-usb-=
adaptors/1693143#1693143=20

I have written in detail the issue in the above link along with other detai=
ls
from various testing that I have done. But in general here is the problem.=
=20

I had two different types of USB3/Sata adapters. One from Hama that seamed =
to
work and another from DeLock that would cause boot issues due to the fact t=
hat
UAS kept resetting the disks. I found that adding a quirks to usb-storage
module, would stop that adapter from being used by UAS and would make it wo=
rk
properly. I also found that the Hama adapter was already pre-disabled within
the usb-storage module, which is why it worked out-of-box. But it also means
that neither of the adapters works with UAS. So if nothing works with this,=
 but
rather just produces problems for people (There are a ton of these issues
across the web), why not remove it altogether. There may be some benefits f=
rom
UAS (When it works), but considering how much havoc it creates, is it worth=
 it?
