This patch only ignores to track inflight SCSI commands on each
LUN, so it doesn't affect the meaning of sdev->queue_depth, which is
just bypassed for SSD.

Yeah, we can do it, but that isn't contradictory with this patch, :-)
And we can do it even though sdev->queue_depth < shost->can_queue.

Usually sdev->queue_depth is used for the following reasons:

1) this limit isn't a hard limit, which may improve IO merge with cost
of IO latency.

2) fair dispatch among LUNs.

This patch just tries to not apply per-LUN queue depth for SSD, because:

1) fair dispatch has been done by blk-mq in allocating driver tag

2) IO merge doesn't play big role for SSD, and IO latency can be
increased by applying per-LUN queue depth.

3) NVMe doesn't apply per-ns queue depth

For megaraid, sdev->device_busy is checked for choosing reply queue,
this way shouldn't be better than using default managed IRQ's mapping.
Similar usage is done on _base_get_high_iops_msix_index().

The only effect may be in scsih_dev_reset(), and 'SUCCESS' message
is dumped even though there is in-flight command on this LUN, but it
can be fixed easily.


Thanks,
