Yeah, already fixed up.

That will happen one of the later patches when we drop the 
'driver_byte()' macro completely.

And I've added to explanation to the sg header file.

Check condition is cleaned up, and the clearing of the driver_byte value 
will happen one of the later patches.

I'm not sure if we need a helper here; all other call sites dealing with 
the SG header do it directly, and the driver_status setting will be 
changed later on again.

Yes, will be doing so.
