OK. But I still think that disk_set_zoned() is the place where the default for
use_zone_write_lock should be set.

And we need a clean way for the LLD to change use_zone_write_lock.

Because use_zone_write_lock should ever be true for !BLK_ZONED_NONE case.
Allowing use_zone_write_lock to be true even with zoned == BLK_ZONED_NONE forces
to always check that the device is zoned to ensure that the value of
use_zone_write_lock is valid. This is awckward and uselessly complicate things.

Sure, that would work. But again, why the need to check both model and actual
value of use_zone_write_lock ? I do not think it is that hard to keep
use_zone_write_lock to false for the BLK_ZONED_NONE case. Then
blk_use_zone_write_locking() is reduced to returning the value of
use_zone_write_lock.
