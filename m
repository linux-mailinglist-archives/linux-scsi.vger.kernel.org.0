Specifically, the following checking & setting has to be done atomically,
so shost->scan_mutex is required, just as what scsi_finish_async_scan()
does for clearing shost->async_scan:

scsi_prep_async_scan():

	if (!shost->async_scan)
		return NULL;
	...
	shost->async_scan = 1

I think it is doable to remove the ->host_lock from both scsi_prep_async_scan()
and scsi_finish_async_scan(), which can be done as one follow-up cleanup.

With this patch, all reading/writing shost->async_scan are protected by
shost->scan_mutex.
