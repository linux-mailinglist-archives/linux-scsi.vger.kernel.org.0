many customer complaints about this that we reverted commit 9604eea5bd3a =
in rhel-8.

This sounds puzzling. The patch 9604eea5bd3a has been signed off by you. =
Now you say that=20
there were a number of regressions, so that you have reverted the commit =
in rhel-8. Yet, there
have been no reports of regressions in linux-scsi. Or have I missed =
something?


I have made some experiments with st.c from v6.4 (before the commit) and =
v6.7 after the
commit. My (slightly tuned) scsi_debug was started with option =
'scsi_level=3D6'. The
test used the stinit tool that can be used to set st parameters after a =
drive has been
detected (using, e.g., udev). (And I think  that any decently configured =
Linux system
with tape drives should set the proper parameters for the drives.)

The test uses modprobe to load scsi_debug (and this loads also st). =
After that
the tools mentioned above were tried:

st.c from v6.4:
- stinit succeeds
- 'dd if=3D/dev/nst0 of=3D/dev/null bs=3D10240 count=3D10' succeeds

st.c from v6.7:
- stinit fails
- dd fails


So, there is are clear regressions caused by commit =
9604eea5bd3ae1fa3c098294f4fc29ad687141ea
and this must be fixed. One method is, of course, to revert the commit. =
Another alternative is to do
something to solve the problems created by the commit.

Modifying st to accept what stinit uses even is pos_unknown is true =
fixes the stinit problem,
but dd still fails. Not setting pos_unknown after the initial POR UA =
fixes both problems.
