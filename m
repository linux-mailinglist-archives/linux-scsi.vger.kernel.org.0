Hi Christoph,

Feedback that helps improving a patch series is always welcome.

Here is how I see fair tag sharing:
* Users probably want to configure minimum and maximum bandwidth or IOPS
   values instead of an equal number of tags per request queue. I assume
   that the fair tag sharing algorithm assigns an equal number of tags to
   each request queue since the run-time cost of the latter algorithm is
   much lower than the run-time cost of the previous algorithms.
* Any algorithm that is more sophisticated than the current fair tag
   sharing algorithm would have a higher runtime cost. We don't want to
   increase the cost of command processing in the block layer core.

Hence my proposal to disable the fair tag sharing algorithm if it's not
needed. I don't see a good alternative to this approach.

Thanks,

Bart.
