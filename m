The intent was to bring this to the tester's notice. My expectation is 
that this would be removed once the root cause is known. The issue was not 
reproducible internally.

In retrospect, this should have been under the driver debug tunable (which 
is set usually by testers).

I can post a follow on patch, with the WARN/log message under driver 
debug.
