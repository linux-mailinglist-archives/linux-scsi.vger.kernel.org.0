I was wrong:

The virtio-scsi specification contains no alignment requirements for I/O
buffers. It is fine for the driver to submit iovecs with any memory
alignment.

The QEMU code allocates a bounce buffer if the iovecs submitted by the
driver do not match the minimum alignment requirements on the host (e.g.
O_DIRECT requirements).

It makes sense that vhost_scsi needs to use a bounce buffer in cases
where the underlying storage has stricter memory alignment requirements.
