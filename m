smp_utils is a package of command line utilities for invoking SMP functions
to monitor and manage SAS expanders. SMP is the Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
Serial Management Protocol. A SAS Host Bus Adapter (HBA) includes a SMP
initiator (along with SSP and STP initiators). A SAS expander contains a
SMP target. Most SAS HBAs have a SMP pass through interface that can be
used to send SMP requests and receive the responses. This package is
designed to work with the Linux kernel (lk) 2.6, 3, 4 and 5 series;
FreeBSD 9.0 (and later) and recent Solaris versions.

Three interfaces are available for Linux: "sgv4", "mptctl" and "aac".
The "sgv4" interface uses the bsg driver. The "aac" interface requires
a recent aacraid driver and firmware in the controller.

The SAS-4 standard is broken into two parts. The latest freely accessible
electrical and physical part is sas410b.pdf . The upper layers are found in
the "SAS Protocol Layer" (SPL) document: spl5r09.pdf . Both pdfs can
be found at https://www.t10.org/ .

These utilities should be SAS-4 ready. SAS-4's baud rate of 22.5 Gbps is
referred to as "G5" in SPL. Note that some SAS specific utilities required
for SAS management can be found in other packages. For example the sdparm
utility (package name: sdparm) lists SAS VPD pages (e.g. Protocol Specific
LU/Port pages) and accesses SAS mode pages (e.g. select wide port
connections with the "Shared Port Control" mode page). The sg_logs utility
in sg3_utils decodes several SAS specific log pages.
