BTW, for the other SCSI HBA drivers which use libsas, it would be better 
if they could stop managing their own tags and switch to use the request 
tag. That would mean that we need to reserve some tags, which is 
currently not done in those drivers (pm8xxx, anyway).

If I were to make this change, are there mvsas and aic9xxx cards around 
to test? I have a pm8xxx card.

Thanks,
John
