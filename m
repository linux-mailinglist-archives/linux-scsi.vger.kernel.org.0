Thanks for pointing that out, I will leave context further down as
well intact.

mpt3sas folks, block-layer experts the above thread seems to have been
stalled recently, do you have any input on the way forward or if
indeed mpt3sas driver is behaving as expected here as well?

Filippo recently reported an issue while setting up a system at
wikimedia, https://bugs.debian.org/1121006 and
https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T407586 for full context.

Regards,
Salvatore
