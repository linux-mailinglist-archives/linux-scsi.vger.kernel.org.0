I think you can read the current code as well as I can:

static inline struct Scsi_Host *dev_to_shost(struct device *dev)
{
	while
(!scsi_is_host_device(dev)) {
		if (!dev->parent)
			return NULL;
		dev =
dev->parent;
	}
	return container_of(dev, struct Scsi_Host,
shost_gendev);
}

The broad point is that this is open source, not some proprietary OS. 
I'm not giving you an API set in stone and you have to figure out the
use cases, I'm telling you how the current API behaves and the reason
why it behaves this way.  If there's an expansion or change you need,
provided it supports the current uses and is maintainable, it can be
done.  What you have to tell me is what you're trying to do.

I've got to say that sounds like a solution looking for a problem.

The fast path of SCSI is pretty rigorously checked with high iops
devices these days.  The fact that this iterator is really lock heavy
but has never been fingered in any of the traces indicates that it's
probably not really a problem that needs solving.
