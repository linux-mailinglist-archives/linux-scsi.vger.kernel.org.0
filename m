Dear Don,

When I understood Martin correctly, he already pulled the patches in. 
It’d be great if you added it in an answer then.

Well, the below struct members are declared as bool.

         u8      volume_offline : 1;
         u8      rescan : 1;
         bool    aio_enabled;            /* only valid for physical disks */

It’d be great, if you could clean that up in the future.

In my opinion, if bool is used, true/false should be used too.

Ok. My answer should have also been to use a bitfield. Sorry about that. 
It does not look nice to me to add new attributes to work around 
firmware isuses.

Yes, I figured. But the function name is still incorrect/misleading then?

Instead of

+	if (pqi_is_tape_changer_device(device) && device->ignore_device) {
+		rc = -ENXIO;
+		device->ignore_device = false;
+	}
+
+	return rc;

I meant

+	if (pqi_is_tape_changer_device(device) && device->ignore_device) {
+		device->ignore_device = false;
+		return -ENXIO;
+	}
+
+	return 0;

Lastly, some (debug) log messages would always be helpful in my opinion, 
if stuff is worked around.


Kind regards,

Paul
