I don't think all driver authors agree with that assumption (and it isn't
documented anywhere). 

The most trivial case is device mapper, where the crypto profіle is freed
before putting the gendisk reference acquired by blk_alloc_disk.  So
anyone who opened the sysfs file at some point before the delete can
still have it open and triviall access freed memory when then doing
a read on it after the dm table is freed.

For UFS things seem to work out ok because the ufs_hba is part of
the Scsi_Host, which is the parent device of the gendisk.

Yes, every queue/ object that references the gendisk has a problem I think.
I've been wading through this code and trying to fix it, which made me
notice this code.

Indeed.

Do we even need the link instead of letting the user walk down the
directory hierachy?  But yes, having the sysfs attributes on the
actual object is a much better idea.
