Hmmm, no response. Any LLD that decides to support blk_poll() and
relies on the mid-level eh handling will get burnt by this. And those
LLDs that do their own eh handling needs to take care not to replicate
the mid-level's eh handling in this case.

An even simpler approach for the mid-level eh handling to address
(at least partially) this problem, is to do:
    rqq->cmd_flags &= ~REQ_HIPRI;

on retried requests. Clearing the REQ_HIPRI flag, if present, should
make the LLD behave the way the mid-level eh processing expects.
