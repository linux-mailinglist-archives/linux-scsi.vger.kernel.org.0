As already said, I have tested the patch for over a year now and I have
never experienced the problem that you are foreseeing !

The current alternative is data corruption each time that the drive is
mounted and the inability to use it.

So, the patch is the way forward for using such drives plug and play
without cumbersome configuration such as disabling the write cache,
which advanced users can always make.

It works well even with write caching enabled.

If you have an alternative patch to propose, go ahead otherwise I would
push for getting this merged and sorting out the issue for good.
