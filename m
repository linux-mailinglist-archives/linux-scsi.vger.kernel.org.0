That's because with the first result the command is requeued (due to 
DID_OK), whereas in the latter result the command is aborted (due to 
DID_ABORT).

So the question really is whether we should retry the commands which 
have REQ_HIPRI set, or whether we shouldn't rather complete them with 
appropriate error code.
A bit like enhanced BLOCK_PC requests, if you will.

Like I said above: it's not only scsi EH which would need to be 
modified, but possibly also the result evaluation in 
scsi_decide_disposition(); it's questionable whether a HIPRI command 
should be requeued at all.

But this might even affect the NVMe folks; they do return commands with 
BLK_STS_RESOURCE, too.

Maybe we should open a larger discussion on the block list.

Cheers,

Hannes
