Arg... Again... Since the change of scsi layer to use async PM operations for
suspend/resume, ATA side has been a constant source of issues. When the change
was done, I did not notice any issue but several users reported problems.

I would have expected issues on the resume side. But it seems you are getting a
hang on suspend, which is new. How quick are your suspend/resume cycles ? I did
use rtcqake for my tests as well, but I was setting the wake timer at +5s or
more and suspending with "systemctl suspend".

I do not think so. Suspend will issue a start stop unit command to put the drive
to sleep and resume will reset the port (which should wake up the drive) and
then issue an IDENTIFY command (which will also wake up the drive) and other
read logs etc to rescan the drive.
In both cases, if the commands do not complete, we would see errors/timeout and
likely port reset/drive gone events. So I think this is likely another subtle
race between scsi suspend and ata suspend that is causing a deadlock.

The main issue I think is that there is no direct ancestry between the ata port
(device) and scsi device, so the change to scsi async pm ops made a mess of the
suspend/resume operations ordering. For suspend, scsi device (child of ata port)
should be first, then ata port device (parent). For resume, the reverse order is
needed. PM normally ensures that parent/child ordering, but we lack that
parent/child relationship. I am working on fixing that but it is very slow
progress because I have been so far enable to recreate any of the issues that
have been reported. I am patching "blind"...

Any chance you could get a thread stack dump when the system hangs ?

echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger

And:

echo d > /proc/sysrq-trigger

would be useful as well...

That is, unless you really have a hard lockup...

If you can get the above ? dmesg output as well with PM debug messages turned on.

Also, what is your setup ? What machine, adapter and drive are you using ?
