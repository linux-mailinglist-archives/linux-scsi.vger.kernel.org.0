I was really only talking about the apparently silly structure of:

void foo(bool in_bar) {
	if (in_bar)
		//do thing
	...
}
void bar() {
	foo(true);
}

vs.:

void foo() {
	...
}
void bar() {
	//do thing
	foo();
}

...but yes, regardless of exactly where it happens, rounding up or not 
is the problem for rcaches in general. I've said several times that my 
preferred approach is to not change it that dynamically at all, but 
instead treat it more like we treat the default domain type.

Well, right now neither call rounds up, which is why iommu-dma takes 
care to avoid any issues by explicitly rounding up for itself 
beforehand. I'm just concerned that giving the impression that the API 
takes care of everything for itself will make it easier to write broken 
code in future, if that impression is in fact not entirely true.

I don't even think it's very likely that someone would manage to hit 
that rather wacky alloc/free pattern either way, I just know that 
getting wrong-sized things into the rcaches is an absolute sod to debug, 
so...

Robin.
