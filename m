As discussed in a previous workaround for a BusLogic BT-958 problem with 
VPD inquiries with an allocation length of 512 bytes as requested before 
commit af73623f5f10 ("[SCSI] sd: Reduce buffer size for vpd request") 
are rejected outright as invalid at least by some SCSI target devices as 
are any requests with a non-zero value in byte #3:

sd 0:0:1:0: scsi_vpd_inquiry(0): buf[262] => -5

(here with the buffer size tweaked to 262 so as to verify if a bit in 
byte #3 of the INQUIRY command is ignored and the length of 6 assumed or 
tripped over, the `BusLogic=TraceErrors' parameter and trailing sense 
data zeros trimmed for brevity).  Note the sense key of 0x5 denoting an 
illegal request.

For the record with the buffer size of 6 requests for page 0 complete 
successfully and due to page truncation `scsi_get_vpd_page' proceeds 
with an attempt to get inexistent page 0x89:

sd 0:0:0:0: scsi_vpd_inquiry(0): buf[6] => 7
sd 0:0:1:0: scsi_vpd_inquiry(0): buf[6] => 13
sd 0:0:0:0: scsi_vpd_inquiry(137): buf[6] => -5
sd 0:0:1:0: scsi_vpd_inquiry(137): buf[6] => -5

Upon a further investigation it has turned out at least SCSI-2 considers 
byte #3 of the INQUIRY command[1] as well as byte #2 of vital product 
data pages[2] reserved and expects a value of zero there.  The response 
from SCSI-3 devices shown above indicates the same expectation.

Therefore it is unsafe to issue INQUIRY requests unconditionally with 
the allocation length beyond 255, as they may fail with an otherwise 
supported request or cause undefined behaviour with some hardware.

Now we actually never do that as all our callers of `scsi_get_vpd_page' 
either hardcode the buffer size to a value between 8 and 255 or 
calculate it from a structure size, of which the largest is:

struct c2_inquiry {
	u8                         peripheral_info;      /*     0     1 */
	u8                         page_code;            /*     1     1 */
	u8                         reserved1;            /*     2     1 */
	u8                         page_len;             /*     3     1 */
	u8                         page_id[4];           /*     4     4 */
	u8                         sw_version[3];        /*     8     3 */
	u8                         sw_date[3];           /*    11     3 */
	u8                         features_enabled;     /*    14     1 */
	u8                         max_lun_supported;    /*    15     1 */
	u8                         partitions[239];      /*    16   239 */

	/* size: 255, cachelines: 2, members: 10 */
	/* last cacheline: 127 bytes */
};

As from commit b3ae8780b429 ("[SCSI] Add EVPD page 0x83 and 0x80 to sysfs")
we now also have the SCSI_VPD_PG_LEN macro that reflects the limitation.

However for the sake of a possible future requirement to support VPD 
pages that do have a length exceeding 255 bytes and now that the danger 
of using the formerly reserved byte #3 of the INQUIRY command has been 
identified execute calls to `scsi_get_vpd_page' with a request size 
exceeding 255 bytes in two stages, by determining the actual length of 
data to be returned first and only then issuing the intended request for 
full data.

Hi,

 NB the SCSI-2 working draft is the only normative reference I have access 
to, downloaded many years ago and not online anymore.  I have more recent 
vendor documents that do indicate that bytes #3 & #2 respectively are a 
part of the length field, but based on empirical evidence presented here 
it is unsafe to unconditionally assume that the bytes can be set to a 
non-zero value.  So I think it will be safest long-term if we handle it 
correctly right away now that the knowledge is fresh, as past experience 
with commit af73623f5f10 ("[SCSI] sd: Reduce buffer size for vpd request") 
indicates the circumstances are not always correctly understood.

 No backport requested as we have no current use that would request VPD 
data beyond 255 bytes.

  Maciej

No changes from v1.
