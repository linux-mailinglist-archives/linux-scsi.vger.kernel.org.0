Yes, it does.

No, it's pretty useful and I'd bet my 2 cents that it will eventually
show up in relevant standards and devices.

Even if it wasn't making our user interfaces exclusive would be a
massive pain.

Yes, I think this is the smoking gun.  We should be fine with a much
more limited number of lifetime hints, i.e. the user interface only
exposes 5 hints, and supporting more in the in-kernel interfaces seems
of rather doubtfuŀ use.
