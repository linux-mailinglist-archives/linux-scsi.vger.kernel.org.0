Thank you. I have quickly skimmed through the patches, but I didn't
review them thoroughly. Maybe the patchset already implements the
interfaces that I'm thinking about. In such a case please excuse me. I
will give it a more thorough look later today.

Then what exactly does qcom_scm_derive_sw_secret() do? Does it rewrap
the key under some other key?
I had the feeling that there are two separate pieces of functionality
being stuffed into a single patchset and into a single solution.

First one is handling the keys. I keep on thinking that there should
be a separate software interface to unseal the key and rewrap it under
an ephemeral key. Some hardware might permit importing raw keys. Other
hardware might insist on generating the keys on-chip so that raw keys
can never be used. Anyway, the net result is the binary blob + cookie
for the ephemeral key.

Second part is the actual block interface. Gaurav wrote about
targeting fscrypt, but there should be no actual difference between
crypto targets. FDE or having a single partition encrypted should
probably work in the same way. Convert the key into blk_crypto_key
(including the cookie for the ephemeral key), program the key into the
slot, use the slot to en/decrypt hardware blocks.

My main point is that the decision on the key type should be coming
from the user. I can easily imagine a user, which wants to use
password / raw key for documents storage so that it is possible to
recover the data, hw-wrapped long-term key for app & data storage and
generated one-time random key for the swap, so that memory contents
can never be recovered after reboot / device capture.
