People often artificially lower the queue depth to avoid timeouts. The
default timeout is 30 seconds from an I/O is queued. However, many
enterprise applications set the timeout to 3-5 seconds. Which means that
with deep queues you'll quickly start seeing timeouts if a drive
temporarily is having issues keeping up (media errors, excessive spare
track seeks, etc.).

Well-behaved devices will return QF/TSF if they have transient resource
starvation or exceed internal QoS limits. QF will cause the SCSI stack
to reduce the number of I/Os in flight. This allows the drive to recover
from its congested state and reduces the potential of application and
filesystem timeouts.

That's fine. I think we're just saying that the common practice of
allocating very deep queues for each CPU core in the system will lead to
problems since the host will inevitably be able to queue much more I/O
than the drive can realistically complete.

Absolutely!
