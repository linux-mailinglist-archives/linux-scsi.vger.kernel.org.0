Actually, the intention of the 'wwid' attribute was to have a common
place where one could look up the global id.
As such it actually serves a dual purpose, namely indicating that there
_is_ a global ID _and_ that this kernel (version) has support for 'wwid'
attribute. This is to resolve one big issue we have to udev nowadays,
which is figuring out if a specific sysfs attribute is actually
supported on this particular kernel.
Dynamic attributes are 'nicer' on a conceptual level, but make the above
test nearly impossible, as we now have _two_ possibilities why a
specific attribute is not present.
So making 'wwid' conditional would actually defeat its very purpose, and
we should leave it blank if not supported.

Cheers,

Hannes
