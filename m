Agree with this prerequisite since secure boot is essential to build
initial trust in any system whether that system employs TEE, TPM,
secure elements etc.

Does TPM provide replay protected memory to store information such as:
- PIN retry timestamps?
- Hash of encrypted nvme? IMO, having replay protection for user data
on encrypted nvme is a valid use-case.

AFAIK, there exist such systems which provide you with a hardware
crypto accelerator (like CAAM on i.Mx SoCs) that can protect your keys
(in this case RPMB key) and hence can leverage RPMB for replay
protection.

As Linus mentioned in other reply, there are limitations in order to
put eMMC/RPMB drivers in TEE / secure monitor such as:
- One of the design principle for a TEE is to keep its footprint as
minimal as possible like in OP-TEE we generally try to rely on Linux
for filesystem services, RPMB access etc. And currently we rely on a
user-space daemon (tee-supplicant) for RPMB access which IMO isn't as
secure as compared to direct RPMB access via kernel.
- Most embedded systems possess a single storage device (like eMMC)
for which the kernel needs to play an arbiter role.

It looks like other TEE implementations such as Trusty on Android [1]
and QSEE [2] have a similar interface for RPMB access.

So it's definitely useful for various TEE implementations to have
direct RPMB access via kernel. And while we are at it, I think it
should be useful (given replay protection benefits) to provide an
additional kernel interface to RPMB leveraging Trusted and Encrypted
Keys subsystem.
