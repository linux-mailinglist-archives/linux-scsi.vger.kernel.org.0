The reset will clear almost all state, including both the generic PCI
part that pci_reset_function() saves/restores *and* any
device-specific state the PCI core doesn't know about.

That device-specific state isn't saved and restored anywhere in the
sysfs reset path, and the driver doesn't know this reset happened, so
I think all bets are off and we shouldn't expect the driver to work
afterwards.

A user-space reset might make sense if there's no driver bound to the
device, but I don't think it does if there is a driver (except maybe a
trivial stub driver that doesn't actually operate the device).
