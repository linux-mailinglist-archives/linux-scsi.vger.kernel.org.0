Yes, it can handle nesting. As to where to start the scope, this should
be at the boundary of "do not reenter IO path from the reclaim". This
can be a lock which is held for the allocation which will be needed for
an IO induced by the reclaim or any other resouce that will block from
the IO path. Is this more clear now?
