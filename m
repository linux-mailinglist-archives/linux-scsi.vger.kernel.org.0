Looks most of the comment in the following link isn't addressed:

I guess memory waste won't be a blocker.

But it may not be one accepted behavior to reduce average active queue
depth for each LUN by nr_hw_queues times, meantime scheduler queue depth
is increased by nr_hw_queues times, compared with single queue.
