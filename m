I guess this whole codepath will become obsolete if and when support for 
polling queues / io_uring will be implemented for megaraid_sas.
This whole section deals with spreading the load over several hardware 
queues once the dedicated one is at risk of being congested.
But this is only required if someone want to reach high IOPS; so if we 
have poll/io_uring support there won't be a need for this anymore.
Or that's the theory, at least :-)

But the patch should be good enough for now to get your patchset in.

Cheers,

Hannes
