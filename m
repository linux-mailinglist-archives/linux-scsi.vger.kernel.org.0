Well '/proc/scsi/sg/*' is in the public interface, so to remove it
represents a breakage. Like many developers I run lots of virtual
terminals with as few as possible logged in as 'root'. So I consider
it a definite advantage that cat /proc/scsi/sg/debug does not need
elevated permissions like the debugfs equivalent does. The security
folks would probably take the opposite view.

It is in debugfs: cat /sys/kernel/debug/scsi_generic/snapshot
is equivalent to cat /proc/scsi/sg/debug.

So currently we have both. Well not quite as this first series
hasn't been accepted after more than a year of attempts. IMO it
is a bit early to deprecate before the replacement is even in place.


New features are only being placed in debugfs. For example, there
is a new feature in patch 59 of series 2 using the new
ioctl(SG_SET_GET_EXTENDED) and the SG_CTL_FLAGM_SNAP_DEV flag to
programmatically send a snapshot of the sg object tree to
/sys/kernel/debug/scsi_generic/snapped .
