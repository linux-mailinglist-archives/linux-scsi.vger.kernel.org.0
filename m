Yes, the basic idea is acceptable (subject to the comments in my 
earlier email).  In fact, it's probably the best we can do, given the 
constraints we face.

I'm reasonably sure that it's the right thing to check.

Yeah; I'm not certain about how to do it.  One possibility is simply to 
parse the .config file directly at runtime, if the Kbuild system doesn't 
provide the CONFIG_* macros when compiling a host program.

Yes, I agree that this is the approach we should take.
