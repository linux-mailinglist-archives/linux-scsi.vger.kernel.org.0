That would be highly surprising. That particular bit is only ever set if
a timeout has triggered, but the driver did not set any other status.
Which again does _strongly_ depend on the driver; there is not consensus
what the status should be for a timed out command.
So if userspace ever saw this value it would be strongly driver
depended, and there was never any intention that any particular driver
_would_ set this flag.
In short: if it ever was set, it was by accident.
Hence userspace shouldn't check for it.

So I don't think we need to worry about that.

Cheers,

Hannes
