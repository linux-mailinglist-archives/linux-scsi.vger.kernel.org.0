Ugh, I spent many days pouring over the code and digging through debug
traces in order to write those patches. I don't think I'd be able to
give any concrete advice without spending many days and being able to
reproduce multiple times with traces since pretty much any knowledge I
learned during the course of developing those patches has decayed over
the last several years. :( I don't happen to know any dependencies
offhand...

That being said, it seems like:

1. Backporting the revert (the 4th patch in the series) without all
the other patches in the series feels wrong. In the text of the revert
I explicitly refer to the other patches in the series as
prerequisites. I guess you said you tried backporting the other two
patches and they didn't help, though? That's no good. :(

2. I don't think the revert is actually important to backport to
stable. While the first 3 patches were important to fix the problems I
was seeing, the revert was just a cleanup. If the revert is causing
problems in 5.4.x then I'd suggest removing it from 5.4.x

Does that make sense? So ideally you'd submit 3 patches to the stable kerne=
l:

a) Revert the revert

b) Pick ("blk-mq: Add blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queues() API call")

c) Pick ("blk-mq: Rerun dispatching in the case of budget contention")


FWIW, we seem to have all 4 patches in the ChromeOS 5.4 kernel tree.
They all landed together plus 1 prerequisite.

* https://crrev.com/c/2155423 - FROMGIT: Revert "scsi: core: run queue
if SCSI device queue isn't ready and queue is idle"
* https://crrev.com/c/2133069 - FROMGIT: blk-mq: Rerun dispatching in
the case of budget contention
* https://crrev.com/c/2155422 - FROMGIT: blk-mq: Add
blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queues() API call
* https://crrev.com/c/2125232 - FROMGIT: blk-mq: In
blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list() "no budget" is a reason to kick
* https://crrev.com/c/2155421 - UPSTREAM: blk-mq: Put driver tag in
blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list() when no budget

When I saw the prerequisite in there I was hopeful that it was the one
you needed, but it looks like that's already in 5.4 stable so (I
presume) you've already been testing with it...
