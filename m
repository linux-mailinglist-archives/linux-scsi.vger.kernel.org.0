I changed that one. ^^^

That's not so clear to me, but then I don't have access to the UFS specs.

This help text:
	  UFS host adapter (the card
	  inside your computer that "speaks" the UFS protocol, also
	  called UFS Host Controller)

might imply that the spec calls it "UFS Host Controller", but I can't
read it (AFAIK). OTOH, if that's just a common (non-spec) name for it,
then yes, it should be in lower case ("controller").

I'm leaning towards using "controller" everywhere -- or not changing
any of them. :)
Oh well.

Do you have any insights into this?

thanks.
