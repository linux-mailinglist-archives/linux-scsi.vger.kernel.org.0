It isn't correct, the in-tree code doesn't have such stall, no matter if
IO is issued from HK or isolated CPUs since the managed irq is guaranteed to
live if any mapped CPU is online.

Please see irq_do_set_affinity():

        if (irqd_affinity_is_managed(data) &&
              housekeeping_enabled(HK_TYPE_MANAGED_IRQ)) {
                  const struct cpumask *hk_mask;

                  hk_mask = housekeeping_cpumask(HK_TYPE_MANAGED_IRQ);

                  cpumask_and(&tmp_mask, mask, hk_mask);
                  if (!cpumask_intersects(&tmp_mask, cpu_online_mask))
                          prog_mask = mask;
                  else
                          prog_mask = &tmp_mask;
          } else {
                  prog_mask = mask;

The whole mask which may include isolated CPUs is only programmed to
hardware if there isn't any online CPU in `irq_mask & hk_mask`.

I understand the trouble, but it is still one improvement from user
viewpoint instead of feature since the interface of 'isolcpus=manage_irq'
isn't changed.

It isn't documentation thing, it breaks the no-regression policy, which crosses
our red-line.

If you really want to move on, please add one new kernel command
line with documenting the new usage which requires applications to
offline CPU in order.
