Retry logic is already in place in the ufshcd core, but with this kind of signal
integrity issue, we cannot guarantee that it will gracefully fail and then we
could retry. The link up *may* succeed, then it could blow up later also (when
doing heavy I/O operations etc...). So with this non-deterministic behavior, we
cannot rely on this logic.

Other platforms could also reuse the same DT properties to workaround similar
issues.

Suggestions are always welcomed. It is important to have comments to try out
different things instead of sticking to the proposed solution. But in my
opinion, the retry logic is not reliable in this case. Moreover, we do have
similar properties for other peripherals like PCIe, MMC, where the vendors would
use DT properties to limit the speed to workaround the board issues. So we are
not doing anything insane here.

If there are better solutions than what is proposed here, we would indeed like
to hear.
