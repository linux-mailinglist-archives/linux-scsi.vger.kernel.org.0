Yeah, you've tested it, are you sure that Micron's UFS devices are OK
with this specific code line?

Micron UFS FW team has confirmed that Micron's HPB entries read out by
"HPB Buffer Read" cmd are in big-endian byte ordering.

If Micron FW team is right, I am pretty sure that you would have seen
random read performance regression on Micron UFS devices caused by
invalid HPB entry format in HPB Read cmd UPIU (which leads to L2P cache
miss in device side all the time) during your test.
