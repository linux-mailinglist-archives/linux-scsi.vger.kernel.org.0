Precisely. One could argue that this is an issue with the current 
driver, too; if all tags have timed-out there is no way how we can send 
a LUN reset even now. Hence we need to reserve a tag for us to reliably 
send a LUN reset.
And this was precisely the problem what sparked off this entire 
patchset; some drivers require a valid tag to send internal, non SCSI 
commands to the hardware.
And with the current design it requires some really ugly hacks to make 
this to work.

Cheers,

Hannes
