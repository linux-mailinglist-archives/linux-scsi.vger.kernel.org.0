Yes, I signed-off on a patch that introduced a regression.  Of course, I was unaware of this at the time.

Laurence and I worked on commit 9604eea5bd3a (scsi: st: Add third party poweron reset handling) and tested it extensively with a 
scsi gateway using third party resets. The patch fixed the problem. The customer tested it. We told the customer they needed to 
reposition/rewind the tape with mt rewind following any third party poweron/reset event - which apparently happens not 
infrequently in their environment. This worked for the customer so we thought it was good. The st driver had never correctly 
handled a POR UA before so we didn't think the fact that MTIOGET returned EIO following a third party reset was a problem.

However, the part that we were not aware of was: tape drives set a poweron/reset UA when the machine reboots. So we started 
getting complaints from different customers about the fact that MTIOCGET suddenly fails with EIO after upgrade. The work around 
was simple (issue an 'mt rewind') but customers did not like this, and when more than one or two customers started calling and 
complaining about this, we reverted the patch to avoid generating more calls. This is when I opened Bug 219419 - Can not query 
tape status - MTIOCGET fails with EIO.

   https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219419

We have fixed that problem now and the fix, including commit 9604eea5bd3a, is being disseminated in rhel-8 and rhel-9.

I see now that stinit and dd, and possibly other IOCTLS, are unexpectedly failing too. I'm not sure if we can call these 
regressions or not. From what I can see the st driver never really handled POR UA's correctly. It only worked with sg_reset 
(first party reset)... but I agree that customers probably will not like this.

Agreed.

If you want to share the details of exactly what your tests are doing (privately if you'd like) I will try to reproduce your 
results.  Obviously, one problem here is that our tape tests here at RH (and everywhere) are inadequate - at least w.r.t. 
resets. I'm working to improve this.

This is simple enough... I'll add this to my tests.

I really don't want to revert commit 9604eea5bd3ae1. It actually fixes a real problem where the tape drive behind a gateway 
device crashes and resets itself.  Then, because the st driver ignores the POR/UA, it writes a file mark at the BOT.  This 
destroys the customer's backup.  It is a serious problem and a day-one bug.

OK, shouldn't dd fail if the pos_unknown is true?  Basically, anytime the tape device reports that it has been reset the 
application NEEDS to reposition the tape.  And, for that matter, the application should also check and set any options that 
might be wanted.  The application can't just ignore these POR Unit Attentions.

> Not setting pos_unknown after the initial POR UA fixes both problems.

That's fine with me... I just don't understand how you can distinguish "the initial POR UA" from any POR UA.  If you have a 
patch that can figure out how to do this... that's great... let's try.

Thanks for all of your work on this Kai. I will continue to help as much as I can by testing any further patches you have.

However, that will have to be after Christmas.  Things are shutting down here at RH until January 2.

Thanks again,

/John
