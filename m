It seems to me this would apply for any Unit Attention. A hardware device can set a unit attention when ever acted upon by a 
third party.  It is difficult to test this type of event w/out a multi-initiator bus... some kind of configuration that connects 
multiple host to the same SCSI target/lun device.  Large tape library configurations can do this. I don't have a test bed like 
this.

I'm not sure I understand what problem you are trying to solve... are you trying to get the mid layer to report Unit Attentions 
to all ULDs that are attached?  That is, you want the mid layer to report the UA to all ULDs, not just the last/latest ULD?

I don't think that would be a problem. As long as the latest and highest priority UA is reported, older, lower priority UAs can 
be overwritten.  For example, a New Media UA followed by a POR UA - the Power On reset should take precedence.

Yes, definitely. ULDs should check the sense data.

I've tested these patches that you've posted here with my locally attached LTO-5 tape drive.  Everything seems to fine...

You can find the test results at:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219419#c20

Note that I've added my own instrumentation patch on top of your series as it helps with the debug logging.

This is actually what the SCSI device is supposed to do.  If you have a truly SCSI compliant tape device, designed to support 
multi-initiator access, unit attentions are supposed to be maintained on an I_T by I_T basis. So a device reset from one I_T 
will set a UA on all I_Ts, and clearing one I_T will clear only that I_T nexus UA.  But I'm sure that some of the older, legacy, 
tape devices don't do this.

Let me know if I can help by testing any further patches.
