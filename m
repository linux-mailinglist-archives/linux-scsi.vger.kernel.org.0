Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] scsi_debug: change store from vmalloc to sgl
Date:   Mon, 14 Dec 2020 22:28:34 -0500

This patchset is a reworking of a single patch titled:
"[PATCH] scsi_debug: change store from vmalloc to sgl"
sent to the linux-scsi list on 20201105.  That patch depended on
"[PATCH v4 0/4] scatterlist: add new capabilities" which is still
to be accepted through the linux-block tree. The kernel build robot
failed to compile the 20201105 patch due to that missing dependency.

In order to move forward, the first patch in this series adds the
sgl to sgl handling functions into the scsi_debug driver with a
"sdeb_" prefix. The second patch in this set is almost the same
as the original patch from 20201105.

This patchset is based on ithe 5.11/scsi-queue branch in MKP's
repository and builds clean on lk 5.10.0 .

  scsi_debug: add sdeb_sgl_copy_sgl and friends
