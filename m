Well, not so much, actually, because the backup would take twice the
time, that is quite annoying for me. But, apart from that, and from
the efforts of Alan and other people following this issue (thanks), I
would like to point out what I am not sure to have ever made clear
about my support request: I have understood that my problem is quite
specific, and don't want anyone to waste their time to help
specifically *me* (I can buy another media, use the "64" tweak, or
find any other workaround). But since we have identified the problem
as kernel-related, I am worried for other users, maybe new to linux,
that can have the same problem, and the evidence for them would be
that linux is extremely slow to copy file over some USB media. So,
among all the technical comments, I would like to make clear (if it's
not already clear) that in my opinion it would be important to solve
the problem without the need of user workarounds. Does it make sense?
Are we moving towards that goal?

BTW, another question: Alan refers to the slow media as a "consumer-
grade USB storage device". What could I do to identify and buy a "good
media"? Are there any features to look for?

Many thanks, and sorry if I ask anything obvious.
Bye,
Andrea
