Apparently nobody has understood that this was how you intended it to
work, me included. Was it your intention to manage this organization on
your own?

I guess it's the fact that people don't understand that this is what
they're supposed to do. People are still creating issues and pull
requests on Doug's repository.=20

I would say so, yes. There are currently 18 open issues and 18 PRs open
at doug-gilbert/sg3_utils. Not overwhelming, but not negligible
either.=C2=A0

It would be helpful if we could simply migrate them from there to
linux-scsi. Be it only to have a clean transition and be able to
redirect future issues or PRs to the new organization.

I'd prefer that over having to recreate the issues one by one. There
are certainly some that can simply be closed, but even that is
impossible for any of us to do in Doug's repos. Moving them to linux-
scsi in a batch and then either closing or merging them looks like the
cleanest way forward to me.

Personally, I misunderstood your intentions. I was expecting sort of a
"kick-off" for the new organization, possibly invitations for co-
maintainers, and a batch issue migration.=C2=A0I wasn't expecting that _you=
_
do all this; rather I thought that some people would collaborate to
make it happen. I was reluctant to duplicate issues manually before
this transition. And I admit it never occurred to me to send sg3_utils
patches to the mailing list.

I realize that these expectations were wrong. But apparently I was not
the only one who didn't quite understand. Perhaps we can use this email
thread to get everyone on the same page.

Thanks,
Martin
