From: Xiang Chen <chenxiang66@hisilicon.com>

Right now hisi_sas driver has already supported runtime PM, and it works
well on base functions. But for some exception situations, there are some
issues related to libsas layer:
- Remove a directly attached disk when sas host is suspended, a hang will
occur in the resume process, patch 1~2 solve the issue;
- Insert a new disk (for expander) during suspended, and the disk is not
revalidated when resuming sas host, patch 4~7 solve the issue;
- SMP IOs from libsas may be sending when sas host is suspended, so resume
sas host when sending SMP IOs in patch 9;
- New phyup may occur during the process of resuming controller, then work
of DISCE_DISCOVER_DOMAIN of a new phy and work PORTE_BYTES_DMAED of suspended
phy are blocked by each other, so defer works of new phys during suspend
in patch 10~12;
- Work PORTE_BROADCAST_RCVD and PORTE_BYTES_DMAED are in the same 
workqueue, but it is possible that they are blocked by each other, 
so keep sas host active until finished some work in patch 14.

And patch 3 which is related to scsi/block PM is from Alan Stern 
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20210714161027.GC380727@rowland.harvard.edu/)

Alan Stern (1):
  scsi/block PM: Always set request queue runtime active in
    blk_post_runtime_resume()
