Hi Damien,

Last week I noticed that a basic test in our validation started failing,
then I noticed that it was subsequent quick suspend and autoresume using
rtcwake that was problematic.

I couldn't collect any specific log that was pointing to some useful direction.
After a painful bisect I got to this patch. After reverting in from the
top of our tree, the tests are back to life.

The issue was that the subsequent quick suspend-resume (sometimes the
second, sometimes third or even sixth) was simply hanging the machine
in different points at Suspend.

So, maybe we have some kind of disks/configuration out there where this
start upon resume is needed? Maybe it is just a matter of timming to
ensure some firmware underneath is up and back to life?

Well, please let me know the best way to report this issue to you and what
kind of logs I should get.

Meanwhile if this ends up blocking our CI we can keep a revert in a
topic branch for CI.

Thanks,
Rodrigo.
