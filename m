Hi Ahmed,

To me, what you're doing seems fine.

I was looking for some API to manage small memory pools and which is 
atomic safe to avoid passing the context flag, but I didn't find such a 
thing.

Just one other thing to mention:
I have a patch to remove the indirection in libsas notifiers:
https://github.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/commit/87fcd7e113dc05b7933260e7fa4588dc3730cc2a

I was going to send it today. Hopefully, if community has no problem 
with it, you can make your changes with that in mind.

Thanks,
John
