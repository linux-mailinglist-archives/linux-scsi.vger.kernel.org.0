Glad to write to you. I avail myself of this opportunity to approach you for an establishment of a business relationship with you. I got your contact through LinkedIn and would like to discuss more with you about this opportunity. 

I would like to send a summary of this business for your review. 

Could you please take a few minutes of your time to revert back to this mail???

Best Regards,
Philip Li Wong.
