Even without parallel disk scan on boot to ensure a consistent naming of drives
from some port or LUN order, any run-time event that cause a drive to "go away"
and come back (e.g. topology change event) can result in the drive name
changing. The order itself depends on the LLD code too. A driver change can
result in a different probe order, so in different names. Same if say you
create/delete LUNs on a RAID system: when doing it, you will get some drive
names, but after a reboot & scan, the LUNs may be presented with different
names. /dev/sdX names are simply not reliable. For consistent, reliable, drive
configurations, applications must use the /dev/disk/by-*/* IDs.
