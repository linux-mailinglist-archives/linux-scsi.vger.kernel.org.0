Recently I came across this from RedHat which shows that the open source
provisioning applications have similarly run into the same issues with =
the
orphaned devices being re-used by different volumes. In light of this, =
in a
more dynamic world where connections and disconnections will be more
common, does this change the idea around device purging in the kernel
for LUN ID=E2=80=99s not returned in the reported LUN list? It seems =
like each of
these provisioning tools will hit this if they don=E2=80=99t account =
specifically for it.
