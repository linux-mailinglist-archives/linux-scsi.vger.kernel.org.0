It looks like this deals with the fault reset workqueue no longer being cleaned up:

0fde22c5420e ("scsi: mpt3sas: Stop fw fault watchdog work item during system shutdown")

I still have questions about the other stuff that is skipped, or what
problem was actually being solved by skipping the dma pool
cleanup. Doesn't skipping that leave mappings behind in the iommu?

Is any of this memory a location that the firmware was trying to write
to before that is mentioned in the commit message?
