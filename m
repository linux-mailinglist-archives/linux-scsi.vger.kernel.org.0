I have read code and done experiments. I think I now know how the POR =
UAs were lost
in 1990s. And why that does not happen now.

In 1.3.30, scsi.c handled resets. When resetting, it set the =
device->expecting_cc_ua flag.
If UA was received when expecting_cc_ua was set, the command was retried =
if
retries were allowed. St allowed five retries for TEST UNIT READY and so =
the POR UA
was left in the midlevel. (If expecting_cc_ua was zero, UA:s were =
returned to the upper
level.)

Now, st does allow zero retries. In addition to this, the requests use =
either REQ_OP_DRV_IN
or REQ_OP_DRV_OUT and these requests are not retried. So, now POR UAs =
reach
st (as the experiments have indicated).

>=20
Using device->was_reset has the advantage that it does not depend on the
drives sending UA. However, I think that a probability of a working =
drive
not sending UA after reset is minimal.

I have a more positive view about scsi_debug. Its tape support is =
minimal, but it can be
useful if you consider what it does support and what it doesn't support.

A real drive is better, of course.

I will send patches tomorrow. The patches will also include a fix to =
another problem:
some parameters should be restored after reset in case of some =
operations like rewind:
the partition, density and block size should be restored to the values =
set before reset.

Thanks for your testing (so far and in future).
