Subject: [PATCH v1 0/3] WriteBooster Feature Support

RFC -> v1:
- Added platform capability for WriteBooster 

RFC-:
v1 -> v2:
- Addressed comments on v1

- Supports shared buffer mode only

- Didn't use exception event as suggested.
  The reason being while testing I saw that the WriteBooster
  available buffer remains at 0x1 for a longer time if flush is
  enabled all the time as compared to an event-based enablement.
  This essentially means that writes go to the WriteBooster buffer
  more. Spec says that the if flush is enabled, the device would
  flush when it sees the command queue empty. So I guess that'd trigger
  flush more than an event based approach.
  Anyway the Vcc would be turned-off during system suspend, so flush
  would stop anyway.
  In this patchset, I never turn-off flush.
  Hence the RFC.
