You can check the source code
(https://github.com/mbitsnbites/osbench/blob/master/src/create_files.c).
There's no sync.

That's not true; the filenames still need to be encrypted.  Filenames encryption
happens right away, not later when the pages are written to disk.  Contents
encryption works differently.

Okay, thanks!
