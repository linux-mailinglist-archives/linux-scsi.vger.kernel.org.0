Oh, it can.
As I said: it's questionable; HIPRI / polled completions are just that,
polling for completions. And a completion indicating a requeue is
_still_ a completion.
So one could argue that we should return here (as it's a completion, and
we're polling for completion).

As mentioned above, I was talking about completions indicating a requeue.
Requeues due to resource shortage on the initiator side would of course
be requeued.
