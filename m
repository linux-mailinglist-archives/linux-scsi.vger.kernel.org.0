After fixing my qemu setup to get rtcwake to work, I succedded in recreating
the hang ! With multiple disks attached to the VM, suspending the VM with an
rtcwake timer set to +1 seconds triggers the resume in the middle of the
suspend and it hangs.

And I found the problem: it is a race in ata_port_request_pm() where the call
to ata_port_wait_eh() is completely innefective, causing suspend and resume to
be scheduled simultaneously, and so one being lost since the pm_msg field is
per port.

I have a fix. I keep doing suspend/resume in the VM and all looks good now.
Cleaning up the patches and I will push a resume-v3 branch soon for you to test.

It seems that the PM code is fine with that. The issue really was with libata :)
