Hi Greg,

Daejun wrote the following on Thursday: "I will find out how to make
the HPB code without blk_insert_cloned_request() API." Unfortunately
that email was sent as MIME-encoded so it was only received by the
people Cc-ed on that email and has not been archived by any of the
websites that archives linux-scsi or linux-block emails. The email
that I received is available below. I think it is fine to make this
email public given the presence of two mailing lists in the Cc-list.

Thanks,

Bart.

     (+Daejun)

     Daejun, can the HPB code be reworked such that it does not use
     blk_insert_cloned_request()? I'm concerned that if the HPB code is not
     reworked that it will be removed from the upstream kernel.

     Thanks,

     Bart.


I will find out how to make the HPB code without blk_insert_cloned_request() API.

Thanks,
Daejun
