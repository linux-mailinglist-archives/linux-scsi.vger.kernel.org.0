Yes, you are right. I missed that one. Patch 2 is not needed at all.=0A=

=0A=
I got confused in my analysis because I missed that the actual timing of=0A=
sd_done() execution is after every command retry+request sense pair, that i=
s,=0A=
what usb_stor_invoke_transport() does. Without patch 1, the resid is wrong =
on=0A=
completion of the initial command because of the request sense, nothing to =
do=0A=
with resid not being initialized.=0A=
W=0A=
ith patch 1, sd_done() sees a resid equal to the entire command size in cas=
e of=0A=
failure, and 0 (as set by usb_stor_invoke_transport()) in case of success.=
=0A=
=0A=
So as you suggested, only patch 1 is necessary. I will resend it with the=
=0A=
additional resid initialization for autosense for security, since that coul=
