Yes, and this is what I expecting to hear Re. hostwide tags.

I'd like to also do the test.

However I would need to forward port the patchset, which no longer 
cleanly applies (I was referring to this 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20180205152035.15016-1-ming.lei@redhat.com/). 
Any help with that would be appreciated.

Maybe the gain of exposing multiple queues+managed interrupts outweighs 
the loss in the LLDD of having to generate this unique tag with sbitmap; 
I know that we did not use sbitmap ever in the LLDD for generating the 
tag when testing previously. However I'm still not too hopeful.

This would not be allowed to block, right?

That could work. However I think that someone may ask why the LLDD just 
doesn't register for the CPU hotplug event itself (which I would really 
rather avoid), instead of being relayed the info from the block layer.
