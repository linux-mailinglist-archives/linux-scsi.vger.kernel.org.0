Thanks Alan.
I understand the issues with the current ufs design.

ufs has a wlun (well-known lun) that handles power management commands,
such as SSUs. Now this wlun (device wlun) is registered as a scsi_device.
It's queue is also set up for runtime-pm. Likewise there're 2
more wluns, BOOT and RPMB.

Currently, the scsi devices independently runtime suspend/resume - request driven.
So to send SSU while suspending wlun (scsi_device) this scsi device should
be the last to be runtime suspended amongst all other ufs luns (scsi devices). The
reason is syncronize_cache() is sent to luns during their suspend and if SSU has
been sent already, it mostly would fail.
Perhaps that's the reason to send SSU during platform-device suspend. I'm not
sure if that's the right thing to do, but that's what it is now and is causing
this deadlock.
Now this wlun is also registered to bsg and some applications interact with rpmb
wlun and the device-wlun using that interface. Registering the corresponding
queues to runtime-pm ensures that the whole path is resumed before the request
is issued.
Because, we see this deadlock, in the RFC patch, I skipped registering the
queues representing the wluns to runtime-pm, thus removing the restrictions to
issue the request until queue is resumed.
But when the requests come-in via bsg, the device has to be resumed. Hence the
get_sync()/put_sync() in bsg driver.
The reason for initiating get_sync()/put_sync() on the parent device was because
the corresponding queue of this wlun was not setup for runtime-pm anymore.
And for ufs resuming the scsi device essentially means sending a SSU to wlun
which the ufs platform device does in its runtime resume now. I'm not sure if
that was a good idea though, hence the RFC on the patches.

And now it looks to me that adding a cb to sd_suspend_runtime may not work.
Because the scsi devices suspend asynchronously and the wlun suspends earlier than the others.

I'm not sure if there's a way to force the wlun to suspend only after all other luns are suspended.
Is there? I hope Bart/others help provide some inputs on this.
