Greetings,

 Please do accept my apologies if my mail does not meet your personal
ethics, I want to introduce myself and this business opportunity to
you. My name is Hon Barrister   Desmond  Williams   , a personal
attorney to my late client. I wish to know if we can work together.

I would like you to stand as the next of kin to my late client who has
an account valued 4.5million United States dollars deposited with the
bank, he died without any registered next of kin and as such the funds
now have an open beneficiary mandate. The board of directors of his
Bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his  next of
kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the Bank as
an abandoned property.

Fortunately, It's very easy for me, even as I am able to certify an
attestation certification on your name to make you become his official
next of kin. If you are interested, do let me know so that I can give
you comprehensive details on what we are to do.

I urgently hope to get your response as soon as possible.  Reply back
to my email . barristerdesmondwilliams971@gmail.com  for  more details
Thanks
Barrister
