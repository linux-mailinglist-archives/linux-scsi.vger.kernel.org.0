In principle, the driver should allow after reset commands that are not
affected by rewind at reset. In practice, there are cases that have not
been handled, like this one. This is, however, somewhat nasty case
because st has to know about the internals of the scsi stack. But,
something has to be done because this is a practical problem.

Your patch should solve this problem, but there are some things that
I would like to address.

The patch includes a huge jump over most of the code. This makes it
a little difficult to understand. I think it would be better to handle =
this
condition locally around the call to flush_buffer(). This would make it
clear to see what this does, without having to check the code being
jumped over.

Another thing is handling the non-empty buffer. Could the patch just
skip flush_buffer() unconditionally? I don't like to have code that
mysteriously fails in some cases without a clear reason: why can't one
ask the IDs even if the buffer is not empty?

This problem also provides an opportunity to slight cleaning the
code by moving handling of pass-through to a new function. The the
rest of st_ioctl() would then just concentrate on the MTIOC_* ioctls.

Thanks, Kai

P.S. The patch seems to miss a newline after the new function.
