FWIW, my employer will probably continue to use the async sg v3
interface for a long time.  If the read/write syscalls are a security
problem, and if we had ioctl()s that are mostly a drop-in replacement
for them, then we could convert our products over to the new ioctl()s on
our next kernel upgrade without too much work (our products are embedded
devices, so we control the whole software stack).  So if you plan to
deprecate the read/write syscall interface anytime soon, then having
drop-in replacement ioctl()s would be beneficial, even if it can't be
done transparently as Doug suggests.
