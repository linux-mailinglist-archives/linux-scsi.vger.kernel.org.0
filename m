Subject: [PATCH v2 20/22] lpfc: Correct function header comments related to ndlp reference counting
Date:   Mon,  1 Mar 2021 09:18:19 -0800
Message-Id: <20210301171821.3427-21-jsmart2021@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.26.2

List-ID: <linux-scsi.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org

Code inspection revealed stale comments in function headers for functions
that call lpfc_prep_els_iocb(). Changes in ndlp reference counting were
not reflected in function headers.

Update the stale comments in function headers to more accurately indicate
ndlp reference counting.
