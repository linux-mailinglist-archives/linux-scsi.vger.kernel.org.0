It was my concern as well, that for this sort of
"backwards-incompatible reason", it has been kept broken
intentionally.

I am not sure if queue_max_sectors() or BLKSECTGET has ever been
implemented in the block layer to give out the limit in bytes, but it
certainly isn't the case anymore.

I am not in position to say whether it's "right" or "wrong" to
implement BLKSECTGET/BLKSSZGET in the sg driver, but they is
definitely useful in some cases (as long as the queue_* functions work
for the given underlying device). Is it not okay if they don't
ultimately work on *some* devices, even when they aren't named SG_*?

Perhaps we can consider having them removed as well (and implement
them as e.g. SG_GET_MAX_SECTORS and SG_GET_LBS; but IMHO that only
makes a point if they can be made to work on more than block devices).

That's exactly my point. They should work identically as the ones
implemented in the block layer, because of their names.

With that said, sg_version needs to be bumped once the fix gets in, so
that there's a way to differentiate the "different implementations" in
userspace.
