Hi Avri,

Thank you for having taken the time to publish your work. The way this
series has been split into individual patches makes reviewing easy.
Additionally, the cover letter and patch descriptions are very
informative, insightful and well written. However, I'm concerned about a
key aspect of the implementation, namely relying on a device handler to
alter the meaning of a block layer request. My concern about this
approach is that at most one device handler can be associated with a
SCSI LLD. If in the future more functionality would be added to the UFS
spec and if it would be desirable to implement that functionality as a
new kernel module, it won't be possible to implement that functionality
as a new device handler. So I think that not relying on the device
handler infrastructure is more future proof because that removes the
restrictions we have to deal with when using the device handler framework.
 Thanks,

Bart.
