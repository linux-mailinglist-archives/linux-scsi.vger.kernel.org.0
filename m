Sure.  That's why I suggested doing it as a follow-up patch.

But if you don't want to write one, that's understandable.  Sometimes I 
think the multitude of PM flags is somewhat over-engineered.  (Even 
though I'm guilty of adding to it...)

Note, however, that this works for SCSI only because SCSI devices don't 
have power-manageable children.  If they did, you could run into a 
situation where the child device wanted to go back to full power during 
a system resume, but was unable to do so because its parent SCSI device 
was still in runtime suspend.  That's the sort of potential problem the 
PM flags were meant to address.  (In fact, you might want to add 
comments to this effect in the sd and UFS drivers' resume routines.)
