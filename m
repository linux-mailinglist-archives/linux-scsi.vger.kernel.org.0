The PCIe NVMe driver has different tag sets for the admin queue and I/O
queues. Additionally, it allocates separate request queues for admin
commands and for I/O commands, just like the UFS driver. Can you be more
specific about why you are referring to the NVMe driver?

Regarding the stub in ufshcd_tmf_ops: moving the code for queueing a TMF
into ufshcd_queue_tmf() and switching to blk_execute_rq() for submitting
TMFs shouldn't be that hard. However, I consider that change as
out-of-scope for this patch series.

In this patch series, reserved commands are used for communicating with
the UFS device. It doesn't matter which struct scsi_device instance is
used for sending reserved commands since UFS host controllers only
support a single UFS device.

The description of that patch says what the patch does but not why the
.reserved_queuecommand() function pointer is introduced. Integrating
that patch into this UFS kernel driver series wouldn't simplify any code
but would lead to some code duplication. Hence, I will leave it to
someone else to integrate that patch in the upstream kernel.

Thanks,

Bart.
