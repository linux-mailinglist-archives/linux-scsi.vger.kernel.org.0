Might, but again not something we should attempt in this patchset.

Using PRE-FETCH might be worthwhile for larger I/O, which we could
easily prepend with a PRE-FETCH command for the entire range.
But then error handling for PRE-FETCH is decidedly tricky, and we might
end up incurring quite some regressions just because we didn't get the
error handling right in the first go.

Worth a shot, but please in another patchset.

The other use-case for using PRE-FETCH after cryptographic erase
definitely is required, but as that's triggered by userspace I would
expect userspace to do it properly, too.

The only valid use-case I see would be for issuing PRE-FETCH after
UNMAP, but that would need to be plugged into the 'discard' machinery,
which is already fragile as hell; I'd rather not attempt that one.

Cheers,

Hannes
