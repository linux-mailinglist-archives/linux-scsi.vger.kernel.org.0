The problem is that mpt3sas uses very weird .can_queue and .cmd_per_lun,
which shouldn't be common.

If .cmd_per_lun is too small, we have to spread the bits among as much
as possible cache lines for avoiding cache line ping-pong, and this kind
of sbitmap principle isn't wrong.

Also we may reduce max queue depth of 1024 too, usually we don't need so
big queue depth to saturate one SSD, and the number should be based on
nvme's setting.

Here the actual depth is .cmd_per_lun(7) which is too small, so each
bit may have to consume one standalone cache line.

I'd suggest to fix mpt3sas for avoiding this memory waste.

Yeah, I have actually one patch to remove sb->map[].depth, which can
reduce each map's size by 1/3.
