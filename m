Can you be clear exactly what you mean by "irrespective of shared host tag"?

Do you mean that for your test Scsi_Host.nr_hw_queues is set to expose 
hw queues and scsi_host_template.map_queues = blk_mq_pci_map_queues(), 
but you just don't set the host_tagset flag?

right

But that is only for when the last CPU for the hctx is going offline. If 
nr_hw_queues == 1, then hctx0 would cover all CPUs, so that would never 
occur during normal operation. See initial check in 
blk_mq_hctx_notify_offline():

static int blk_mq_hctx_notify_offline(unsigned int cpu, struct 
hlist_node *node)
{
	if (!cpumask_test_cpu(cpu, hctx->cpumask) ||
	    !blk_mq_last_cpu_in_hctx(cpu, hctx))
		return 0;

Not sure, I think I need to be clear exactly what you're doing.

I think it's best explained in cover letter for "blk-mq: Facilitate a 
shared sbitmap per tagset".

See points "HBA HW queues are required to be mapped to that of the 
blk-mq hctx", "HBA LLDD would have to generate this tag internally", and 
"blk-mq assumes the host may accept (Scsi_host.can_queue * #hw queue) 
commands".

Great, thanks
