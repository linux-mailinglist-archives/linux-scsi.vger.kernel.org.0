More importantly, the SCSI LLDD needs to be _able_ to expose one hw 
queue per CPU.
Which cannot be taken for granted; especially in larger machines it's 
relatively easy to have more CPUs than MSI-X vectores...

Hmm. That's a very unusual setup. Typically it's the other way round; 
SCSI LLDDs have several completion queues (as these are mapped to MSI-X 
vectors), but only one submission queue.
(Classical examples are mptsas, megaraid_sas, aacraid, and hpsa)

But I still do think we need to handle this case; the HBA might not 
expose enough MSI-X vectors/hw queues for us to map to all CPUs.
In which case we'd be running into the same situation.

And I do think we _need_ to drain the associated completion queue as 
soon as _any_ CPU in that set it plugged; otherwise we can't ensure that 
any interrupt for pending I/O will _not_ arrive at the dead CPU.

And yes, this would amount to quiesce the HBA completely if only one 
queue is exposed. But there's no way around this; the alternative would 
be to code a fallback patch in each driver to catch missing completions.
Which would actually be an interface change, requiring each vendor / 
maintainer to change their driver. Not very nice.

But this case is handled already; things like lpfc and qla2xxx have been 
converted to this model (exposing all hw queues, and use a host-wide 
tagmap).

So from that side there is not really an issue.

I even provided patchset to convert megaraid_sas (cf 'megaraid_sas: 
enable blk-mq for fusion'); you might want to have a look there to see 
how it can be done.

If you would post it on the mailing list (or send it to me) I can have a 
look. Converting SAS is on my list of things to do, anyway.

Thing is, the tag _is_ already generated by the time the command is 
passed to the LLDD. So there is no overhead; you just need to establish 
a 1:1 mapping between SCSI cmds from the midlayer and your internal 
commands.

Which is where the problem starts: if you have to use the same command 
pool for internal commands you have to set some tags aside to avoid a 
clash with the tags generated from the block layer.
That's easily done, but if you do that quiescing is getting harder, as 
then the block layer wouldn't know about these internal commands.
This is what I'm trying to address with my patchset to use private tags 
in SCSI, as then the block layer maintains all tags, and is able to 
figure out if the queue really is quiesced.
(And I really need to post my patchset).

Again; what would you do if not all CPUs from a pool are gone?
You still might be getting interrupts for non-associated interrupts, and 
quite some drivers are unhappy under these circumstances.
Hence I guess it'll be better to quiesce the queue as soon as _any_ CPU 
from the pool is gone.

Plus we could be doing this from the block layer without any callbacks 
from the driver...
