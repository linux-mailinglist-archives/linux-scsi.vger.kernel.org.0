It's true that we waste much memory for regular static requests for when 
using hostwide tags today.

One problem in trying to use a single set of "hostwide" static requests 
is that we call blk_mq_init_request(..., hctx_idx, ...) -> 
set->ops->init_request(.., hctx_idx, ...) for each static rq, and this 
would not work for a single set of "hostwide" requests.

And I see a similar problem for a "request queue-wide" sched static 
requests.

Maybe we can improve this in future.

BTW, for the performance issue which Yanhui witnessed with megaraid sas, 
do you think it may because of the IO sched tags issue of total sched 
tag depth growing vs driver tags? Are there lots of LUNs? I can imagine 
that megaraid sas has much larger can_queue than scsi_debug :)

Thanks,
John
