Thank you for clarifying this. I wasn=E2=80=99t aware that the NCR5380 is s=
o
strictly limited in terms of message support.I assumed a more generic
scenario when applying defensive checks, without considering the practical
behavior of this specific hardware.

That makes sense. My initial assumption was that, even if unlikely, a
malformed or non-compliant message could theoretically appear. But I now
see that this isn=E2=80=99t realistic for these devices, and no evidence su=
ggests
this has ever occurred in the field.

Understood and I agree. Defensive programming without a known issue on
hardware-level interfaces introduces unnecessary complexity.

You=E2=80=99re absolutely right. I misjudged the effect of changing the rea=
d length.

Given this, I=E2=80=99ll drop the patch entirely, as there=E2=80=99s no act=
ual problem to
fix. The intent was only to silence static analysis tools, but I now
realize this isn=E2=80=99t a valid justification for modifying a stable har=
dware-
facing path.

Thanks again for the review and your insights.

Best regards,
Rand Deeb
