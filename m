Wouldn't that mean that all the other requests in the queue, even ones that
don't even need any inline encryption, also don't get processed until the
queue is woken up again? And if so, are we really ok with that?

As you said, we'd need the queue to wake up once a keyslot is available.
It's possible that only some hardware queues and not others get blocked
because of keyslot programming, so ideally, we could somehow make the
correct hardware queue(s) wake up once a keyslot is freed. But the keyslot
manager can't assume that it's actually blk-mq that's being used
underneath, so if we want to get the keyslot manager to do something once
a keyslot was freed, it would need some generic way to signal that to
blk-mq. We can also just wait around for the queue to restart by itself
after some time delay and try to program the keyslot again at that point,
although I wouldn't want to do that because in the current design we know
exactly when a keyslot is freed, and we don't need to rely on potentially
inefficient guesswork about when we can successfully program a keyslot.
Maybe we're alright with waking up all the queues rather than only the
ones that really need it? But in any case, I don't know yet what the
best way to solve this problem is.

We would also need to make changes to handle programming keyslots in
some of the other make_request_fns besides blk_mq_make_request too
(wherever relevant, at least) which adds more complexity. Overall, it seems
to me like trying to manage programming of keyslots on a per-request basis
is maybe more code than what we have now, and I'm not sure what we're
really buying by doing it (other than perhaps the performance benefit of
having to get fewer refcounts on a variable and fewer comparisions of
cryptographic keys).

Also I forgot to mention this in my previous mail, but there may be some
drivers/devices whose keyslots cannot be programmed from an atomic context,
so this approach which might make things difficult in those situations (the
UFS v2.1 spec, which I followed while implementing support for inline
crypto for UFS, does not care whether we're in an atomic context or not,
but there might be specifications for other drivers, or even some
particular UFS inline encryption hardware that do).

So unless you have strong objections, I'd want to continue programming
keyslots per-bio for the above reasons.
