But this could  apply only to FPIN-Congestion. Only in this case FPIN-CN
FPIN events will be generated  with a certain  frequency.
But for FPIN-Li this is not the case.
FPIN-LI is used to inform about marginal paths, which needs manual
intervention to recover.
And for FPIN-LI the path should be re-enabled on any link bounce
(portdisable followed by portenable) which would correlated to a cable/sfp
change.
For now, however, we are addressing FPIN-LI primarily.

Regards,
Muneendra.
