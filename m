Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/1]: scsi dm-mpath do not fail paths which are in ALUA

Martin,

Please confirm that your kernel included ee8868c5c78f ("scsi:
scsi_dh_alua: Retry RTPG on a different path after failure").
That commit should cause the RTPG to be retried on other map members
which are not in failed state, thus avoiding this phenomenon.

In my case, there are no other map members that are not in the failed
state. One set of paths goes to the ALUA unavailable state when the
primary fails, and the second set of paths moves to ALUA state
transitioning as the previous secondary becomes the primary. If the
paths are failed which are transitioning, an all paths down state
happens which is not expected. There should be a time for which
transitioning is a transient state until the next state is entered.
Failing a path assuming there would be non-failed paths seems wrong.

The purpose of that patch was to set the state of the transitioning
path to failed in order to make sure IO is retried on a different path.
Your patch would undermine this purpose.

I agree this is what happens but those transitioning paths might be
the only non-failed paths available. I don't think it is reasonable to
fail them. This is the same as treating transitioning as standby or
unavailable. As you point out this happened with the commit you
mention. Before this commit what I am doing does not result in an all
paths down error, and similarly, it does not in earlier Linux versions
or other OS's under the same condition. I see this as a regression.

Thanks,
Brian
