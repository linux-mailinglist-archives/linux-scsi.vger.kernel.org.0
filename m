hostt is 'struct scsi_host_template' which is defined in LLD module, and
often allocated as static global variable, that is what try_get_module()
tries to protect.

scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext() may be scheduled via schedule_work from
the device object's release handler for releasing the scsi_device, which may
trigger scsi host's release handler in which hostt is required.

If we simply call module_put() after put_device() simply, the module
refcnt may be dropped earlier than running
scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext(), then the kernel panic still can't
be addressed.
