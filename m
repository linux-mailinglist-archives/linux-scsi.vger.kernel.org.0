Yes. And this is what mobile phone vendors typically did.

But the nature of different electrical attacks made them worried
about different schemes involving cutting power and disturbing
signals with different probes, so they wanted this counter
implemented in hardware and that is why RPMB exists at all
(IIUC).

It is fine to be of the opinion that this entire piece of hardware
is pointless because the same can be achieved using
well written software.

The position that the kernel community shall just ignore this
hardware is a possible outcome of this discussion, but we need
to have the discussion anyway, because now a RPMB framework
is being promoted. The people who want it will need to sell it to
us.

This is true, I guess the argument is something along the
line that if one link in the chain is weaker, why harden
any other link, the chain will break anyway?

(The rest of your message seems to underscore this
position.)

I am more of the position let's harden this link if we can
and then deal with the others when they come up, i.e.
my concern is this piece of the puzzle, even if it is not
the centerpiece (maybe the centerpiece is secure boot
what do I know).

Yours,
Linus Walleij
