            Bug ID: 217599
           Summary: Adaptec 71605z hangs with aacraid: Host adapter abort
                    request after update to linux 6.4.0
           Product: SCSI Drivers
           Version: 2.5
          Hardware: All
                OS: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
          Priority: P3
         Component: AACRAID
          Assignee: scsi_drivers-aacraid@kernel-bugs.osdl.org
          Reporter: pheidologeton@protonmail.com
        Regression: No

The controller works fine for a few minutes. Then it hangs for a few tens of
seconds to a few minutes, then also works normally for a while. This bug is
present in the 6.4.0 kernel release (6.3.9 works without hanging)
The messages in dmesg are as follows
