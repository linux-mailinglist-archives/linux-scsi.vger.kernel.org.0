Thank you for _your_ help!

The next merge window is coming up soon.  I think I'll wait until it is 
over before submitting the patch (maintainers tend to be too busy to 
consider new patches during a merge window).

But I am still open to comments or criticism of the patch in the 
meantime.  There hasn't been any feedback since Bart's initial set of 
questions.
