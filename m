These patches are based on Martin Petersen's 5.16/scsi-queue tree
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mkp/scsi.git
  5.16/scsi-queue

This set of changes consist of:
  * Aligning device removal with our out of box driver.
  * Aligning kdump timing with controller memory dump.
    The OS was rebooting before the controller was finished dumping its own
    memory. Now the driver will wait for the controller to indicate that its
    dump has completed.
  * In rare cases where the controller stops responding to the driver, the
    driver can set reason codes to aid in debugging.
  * Enhance device reset operations. The driver was not obtaining the current
    number of outstanding commands during the check for outstanding command
    completions. This was causing reset hangs.
  * Add in a check for HBA devices undergoing sanitize. This was causing long
    boot up delays while the OS waited for sanitize to complete. The fix is to
    check for sanitize and keep the HBA disk offline. Note that the SSA spec
    states that the disk must be manually re-enabled after sanitize has
    completed. The link to the spec is noted in the patch.
  * When the OS off-lines a disk, the SCSI command pointers are cleaned up.
    The driver was attempting to return some outstanding commands that were
    no longer valid.
  * Add in more enhanced report physical luns (RPL) command. This is an
    internal command that yields more complete WWID information.
  * Correct a rare case where a poll for a register status before the
    register has been updated.
  * When multi-LUN tape devices are added to the OS, the OS does its own
    report LUNs and the tape devices were duplicated. A simple fix was to update
    slave_alloc/slave_configure to prevent this.
  * Add in some new PCI devices.
  * Bump the driver version.

Changes since V1:
  * Corrected issues with my e-mail server.
