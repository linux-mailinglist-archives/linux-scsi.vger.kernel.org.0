Reviving this discussion.

Another issue with using ftrace is that several subsystems use it.
Consider a situation in which we store a history of 64 commands, 
responses and some other required info in ftrace.

Say there's a command that's stuck for seconds until the software times 
out. In this case, the other ftrace events are still enabled and keep 
writing to ftrace buffer thus overwriting some/most of the ufs's command 
history; thus the history is more or less lost. And there's a need to 
reproduce the issue with other tracing disabled.

So what we need is a client specific logging mechanism, which is 
lightweight as ftrace and can be parsed from ramdumps.

I'm open to ideas but ftrace in its current form may not be suitable for 
this.
