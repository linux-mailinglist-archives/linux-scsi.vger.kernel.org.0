Thanks, Main. I'll add a new quirk for
ufshcd_hba_execute_hce() as per the actual quirky behavour.

Ok, it seems I need to set {rpm/spm}_lvl = 6 if I want platform to power
down the controller for ultra power-saving. But I still need to add my
own system PM callback in that case to recovery the link first. Do I
misunderstand it?

And for the user who sets the rpm/spm level via
ufs_sysfs_pm_lvl_store(), I think there is no way to block it currently,
except that we need to fix the power-domain driver and Firmware to
respect the level and choose correct policy.


So in summary for what the next step I should to:
(1) Set {rpm/spm}_lvl = 6 in host driver to reflect the expectation
(2) Add own PM callbacks to recovery the link to meet the expectation
(3) Fix the broken behaviour of PD or Firmware to respect the actual
desired pm level if user changes the pm level.


Does that sound feasible to you?


Thanks.
