Device pointers are needed in order to create a device link and it is
quite unlikely that a pointer to an unregistered device will be shared
between two different pieces of code.

So the stateless kref is going to be put first.

IMO until a device object is registered, its creator should be allowed
to do the cleanup in the case when it gets released without
registration, including the removal of any device links to it that
have been added so far.

Messing up with a device object created by someone else that may still
go away without registration is a risky business regardless.
