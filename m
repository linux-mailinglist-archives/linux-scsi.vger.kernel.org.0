No, I can't. I haven't reviewed every caller. I thought about the
function's documentation, which simply says "find the tagged command by
host". Maybe I got this wrong.

You're right that returning non-in-flight requests makes no sense for
drivers calling this function in the request completion code path.

The situation was a bit different until recently, when drivers used
scsi_host_find_tag() also for iterating over commands. The commit
message of e73a5e8e8003 stated that it avoids 'random errors' in this
case; I am not sure if that's actually the case. I can at least imagine
that a driver would want to abort or otherwise invalidate requests even
if they're not in flight yet (e.g. when shutting down a controller).
As the drivers have now been fixed to use blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter(),
there's no need to discuss this further.

Thanks,
Martin
