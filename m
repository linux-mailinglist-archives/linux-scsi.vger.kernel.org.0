Kashyap,
There is another issue here, namely iodepth > host_max_queue (64 > 32)
and in my setup that is not handled well. So there is a problem with
scsi_debug *** or the mid-level in handling this case.

If you have modified the sd driver to call blk_poll() then perhaps
you could try the above test again with a reduced iodepth.

*** the scsi_debug should either yield a TASK SET FULL status or return
     SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY from queuecommand() when it has run out of
     slots.
