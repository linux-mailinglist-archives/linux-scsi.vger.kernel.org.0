Yes.  I'll try to leave a blktrace running to see what causes the
spinup.  I suppose it could be another flush or other command that
doesn't require media access, but triggers runtime pm to spin up the disk.

One of the things my patch series from a decade ago did was to use the
SLEEP flag in libata to decide to complete certain commands without
sending them to the drive so it could remain asleep.  I'm not sure if
it's even possible for the driver to evaluate the command before the pm
core orders a resume though.

I wonder if libata could leave the EH pending and return success from
the runtime resume, and then actually run the EH and wake up the drive
later, when actual IO is done.

On another note, I've been looking over your patches, and I still do not
understand why you added the VERIFY command.  The only effect it seems
to have is moving the delay while the drive spins up from the first real
IO to the resume path.  Why does that matter?
