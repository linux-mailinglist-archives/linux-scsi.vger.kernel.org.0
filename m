OK, will switch to 'int' in V2.

scsi_host_queue_ready() is always called before calling
host->hostt->queuecommand(scmd), and scsi_dec_host_busy() is called
after calling into host->hostt->queuecommand(scmd) in non-failure path.

So the answer is no, they won't be called concurrently, even they won't
be called concurrently with test_and_set_bit(SCMD_STATE_COMPLETE, &cmd->state)
in scsi_mq_done(), which can avoid to re-order between setting SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT
and clearing SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT.

The only exception is that clear_bit(SCMD_STATE_COMPLETE) may be run
concurrently with clear_bit(SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT) because .complete() may
be called in another CPU remotely, but that only happens in case of
blk_should_fake_timeout().

So looks it is safe to change to non-atomic __set_bit() and
__clear__bit().

Thanks,
Ming
