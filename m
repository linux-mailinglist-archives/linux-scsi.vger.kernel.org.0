Hi Alan,

I tried that suggestion with the following change:


--- a/block/blk-pm.c
+++ b/block/blk-pm.c
@@ -185,9 +185,8 @@ EXPORT_SYMBOL(blk_pre_runtime_resume);
   */
void blk_post_runtime_resume(struct request_queue *q, int err)
{
-
+       err = 0;
         if (!q->dev)
                 return;
         if (!err) {


And that looks to solve the deadlock which I was seeing. I'm not sure on 
side-effects elsewhere.

We'll test it a bit more.

Thanks,
John
