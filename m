Oh yeah I also wanted to bring up this patch:

https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg192548.html

The problem with my multi-threading patches is that I was focused on
the cgroup support parts and that lead to some gross decisions.

1. I kept the cgroup support, but as a result I do not have control
over the threading affinity and making sure cmds are executed on a
optimal CPU like the above patches do.

When I drop the cgroup support and make sure threads are bound to
specific CPUs and then make sure IO is run on the CPU it came in on
then IOPs jumps from 600K to 800K for vhost-scsi.

2. I can possible create a lot of threads.

So a couple open issues are:

1. Can we do a thread per cpu that is shared across all vhost devices?
That would lead to dropping the cgroup vhost worker support.

2. Can we just use the kernel's workqueues then?
