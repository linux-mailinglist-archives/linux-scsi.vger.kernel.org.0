One thing to keep in mind is that keyring service keys can't be used directly
for storage encryption.  So if a component that manages storage encryption (such
as fscrypt or dm-crypt) is given a keyring service key, in practice it has to
extract the payload from the keyring service key, and not use the keyring
service key any further.  So the keyring service can, at most, serve as a way to
create and prepare the key, and after that it doesn't serve a purpose.

(fscrypt used to use the keyring service a bit more: it looked up a key whenever
a file was opened, and it supported evicting per-file keys by revoking the
corresponding keyring key.  But this turned out to be totally broken.  E.g., it
didn't provide the correct semantics for filesystem encryption where the key
should either be present or absent filesystem-wide.)

We do need the ability to create HW-wrapped keys in long-term wrapped form,
either via "generate" or "import", return those long-term wrapped keys to
userspace so that they can be stored on-disk, and convert them into
ephemerally-wrapped form so they can be used.  It probably would be possible to
support all of this through the keyrings service, but it would need a couple new
key types:

- One key type that can be instantiated with a raw key (or NULL to request
  generation of a key) and that automagically creates a long-term wrapped key
  and supports userspace reading it back.  This would be vaguely similar to
  "trusted", but without any support for using the key directly.

- One key type that can be instantiated using a long-term wrapped key which gets
  automagically converted to an ephemerally-wrapped key.  This would be what is
  passed to other kernel subsystems.  Functions specific to this key type would
  need to be provided for users to use.

I think it would be possible, but it feels like a bit of a shoehorned API.  The
ioctls are a more straightforward solution.

device-mapper supports passing through the inline encryption support of
underlying devices in certain cases, but it doesn't yet support using it itself.

If the driver has to make a decision about which type of keys to support (due to
the hardware and firmware supporting both but not at the same time), I think
this will need to be done via a module parameter, e.g.
qcom_ice.hw_wrapped_keys=1 to support HW-wrapped keys instead of standard keys.
