Hey,

I'm not sure if we are talking about the same thing. If port state is 
marginal above, then we set the NORETRIES bit then return BLK_EH_DONE 
which will start up the scsi eh_abort_handler and if that fails the rest 
of the scsi eh_*_handlers.

While we are calling the eh handlers, if the driver does a 
fc_remote_port_delete then fc_remote_port_add we still have the 
NORETRIES bit set, so when we return from the eh_*_handlers we will fail 
the IO upwards.

I was trying to ask if you wanted the IO failed upwards in that case. 
Because the port state went to online, did you want the normal (cleared 
NOTRIES bit) cmd retry behavior? It sounds like below you want the 
cleared NORETRIED bit behavior, right?
