It's not a problem on our side.
It's a problem on the target/controller side.
The target/controller might have a need to throttle I/O (due to QoS 
settings or competing resources from other hosts), but currently no 
means of signalling that to the host.
Which, incidentally, is the underlying reason for the DNR handling 
discussion we had; NetApp tried to model QoS by sending "Namespace not 
ready" without the DNR bit set, which of course is a totally different 
use-case as the typical 'Namespace not ready' response we get (with the 
DNR bit set) when a namespace was unmapped.

And that is where SQ head pointer updates comes in; it would allow the 
controller to signal back to the host that it should hold off sending 
I/O for a bit.
So this could / might be used for NVMe HDDs, too, which also might have 
a need to signal back to the host that I/Os should be throttled...

Cheers,

Hannes
