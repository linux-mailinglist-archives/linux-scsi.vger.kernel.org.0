Personally, I wonder if the current implementation of high-IOPs queues 
makes sense with multiqueue.
Thing is, the current high-IOPs queue mechanism of shifting I/O to 
another internal queue doesn't align nicely with the blk-mq architecture.
What we _do_ have, though, is a 'poll' queue mechanism, allowing to 
separate out one (or several) queues for polling, to allow for .. 
indeed, high-IOPs.
So it would be interesting to figure out if we don't get similar 
performance by using the 'poll' queue implementation from blk-mq instead 
of the current one.

Which would also have the benefit that we could support the io_uring 
interface natively with megaraid_sas, which I think would be a benefit 
on its own.

Cheers,

Hannes
