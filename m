Hmmm... I do not recall exactly. I think it was all about being clear and to not
overload trim/discard, or scsi unmap, which at the time was not the prettiest
thing in scsi code (it got better though).

But I do prefer having zone reset separate from trim/discard, to be clear about
the fact that things are zone aligned. From the code perspective, there are only
few places were overloading trim with zone reset would simplify a little the
code. F2fs is probably the main one that comes to mind, but simplification would
be minor. So not worth the confusion I think.
