Hi Christoph, thanks for reviewing this.

Yes, this is a bug: it causes the key to be evicted from only one device.

I'm thinking this might point to deeper problems with the inline encryption API
exposed to filesystems being too difficult to use correctly.  We might want to
move to something like:


struct blk_crypto_key_handle *
blk_crypto_prepare_key(struct request_queue *q, const u8 *raw_key,
                       enum blk_crypto_mode_num crypto_mode, unsigned int data_unit_size);

int bio_crypt_set_ctx(struct bio *bio, struct blk_crypto_key_handle *h,
		      u64 dun, gfp_t gfp_mask);

void blk_crypto_destroy_key(struct blk_crypto_key_handle *h);


Each handle would associate a raw_key, mode, and data_unit_size with a specific
keyslot_manager, which would allocate/evict a keyslot as needed for I/O.
blk_crypto_destroy_key() would both evict the keyslot and free the key.

For each key, multi-device filesystems would then need to allocate a handle for
each device.  This would force them to handle key eviction correctly.

Satya, any thoughts on this?

This is how fscrypt has always worked.  The type of encryption to do is
determined as follows:

S_ISREG() => contents encryption
S_ISDIR() || S_ISLNK() => filenames encryption

See e.g. select_encryption_mode(), and similar checks elsewhere in
fs/{crypto,ext4,f2fs}/.

Do you have a suggestion to make it clearer?

IMO it's not really "weird" given that the point of the fscrypt_operations is to
expose filesystem-specific stuff to fs/crypto/.  But yes, using one of the SB_*
bits would make it simpler, so if people are fine with that we'll do that.

checkpatch reports 4 overly long lines in the patch, 3 of which are the first
line of kerneldoc comments.  For some reason I thought those are recommended to
be one line even if it exceeds 80 characters, but maybe I'm mistaken.

To be clear, the 8-byte IV assumption doesn't really come from fs/crypto/, but
rather in what the blk-crypto API provides.  If blk-crypto were to provide
longer IV support, fs/crypto/ would pretty easily be able to make use of it.

(And if IVs >= 24 bytes were supported and we added AES-128-CBC-ESSIV and
Adiantum support to blk-crypto.c, then inline encryption would be able to do
everything that the existing filesystem-layer contents encryption can do.)

Do you have anything in mind for how to make the API support longer IVs in a
clean way?  Are you thinking of something like:

	#define BLK_CRYPTO_MAX_DUN_SIZE	24

	u8 dun[BLK_CRYPTO_MAX_DUN_SIZE];
	int dun_size;

We do have to perform arithmetic operations on it, so a byte array would make it
ugly and slower, but it should be possible...
