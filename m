Hi Damien-

You're right. The HDD needs those commands in its internal queue to
sort and merge them, because commands are pulled from the SQ strictly
FIFO which precludes any sorting or merging within the SQ. That being
said, HDDs still work better with a good kernel scheduler to group
commands into HDD-friendly sequences. So it would be helpful if we
could devise a method to help the kernel sort/merge before loading the
commands into the SQ, just as we do with SCSI today.

Ming:
Regarding sorting across SQs, I mean to say these two things:
1. The HDD would not try and reach up into the SQs and choose the next
best command. I understand the SQs are FIFO, so that is why NVMe HDD
has to pull them into our internal queue for sorting and merging. Our
internal queue has historically been more than adequate (SAS-256,
SATA-32) to provide pretty good optimization without excessive command
latencies.

2. Also, I know NVMe specifically does not imply any completion order
within the SQ, but an NVMe HDD will likely honor the submission order
within any single SQ, but not try and correlate across multiple SQs
(if the host sets up multiple SQs). I believe this is different from
SSD. I think of this as being left over from SAS/SATA where we manage
overlapped commands by command order-of-arrival.

Many HDD customers spend a lot of time balancing workload and queue
depth to reach the IOPS/throughput targets they desire. It's not
straightforward since HDD command completion time is extremely
workload-sensitive. Some more sophisticated customers dynamically
control queue depth to keep all the command latencies within QOS. But
that requires extensive workload characterization, plus knowledge of
the upcoming workload, both of which makes it difficult for the HDD to
auto-tune its own queue depth. I'm really interested to have this
queue approach discussion at the conference - there seems to be areas
where we can improve on legacy behavior.

In all these scenarios, a single SQ/CQ pair is certainly more than
adequate to keep an HDD busy. Multiple SQ/CQ pairs probably only
assist driver or system architects to separate traffic classes into
separate SQs. At any rate, the HDD won't mandate >1 SQ, but it will
support it if desired.
