Is that really a problem today? From personal experience we hardly ever
have any real SCSI timeouts in our environments, and once we are at the
point where we add commands to EH, we are already past the (default) 30s
timeout for disks IIRC, so is the RCU latency significant at that point?

I'm just wondering, because at least IMHO plain memory barrier are more
complex than RCU - at least in understanding them.
