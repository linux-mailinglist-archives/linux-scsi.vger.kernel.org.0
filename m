That is annoying... But I think the messages give us a hint as to what is going
on. See below.

This is sd 5:0:0:0. All good, ordered properly with the "Synchronizing SCSI cache".

Same here for sd 4:0:0:0.

Arg ! sd 7:0:0:0 is resuming ! But the above "Synchronizing SCSI cache" tells
us that it was suspending and libata EH did not yet put that drive to standby...

> [   80.847660] ata8.00: Entering standby power mode

... which happens here. So it looks like libata EH had both the suspend and
resume requests at the same time, which is totally weird.

...and PM suspend completes here. Resume "starts" now (but clearly it started
earlier already given that sd 7:0:0:0 was reactivated.

And this looks all normal, the drives have all been transitioned to active
power mode as expected. And yet, your system is stuck after this, right ?
Can you try to boot with "sysrq_always_enabled" and try to see if sending
"ctrl-sysrq-t" keys can give you a stack backtrace of the tasks to see where
they are stuck ?

I am going to try something like you do with very short resume rtc timer and
multiple disks to see if I can reproduce. But it is starting to look like PM is
starting resuming before suspend completes... Not sure that is correct. But the
end result may be that libata EH endup getting stuck. Let me dig further.
