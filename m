I had feared you'd say something along these lines ...

Now that throws up a possible problem for the gvp11 driver: due to the 
need to first map an allocated chunk, then possibly discard that and try 
another allocation strategy, copying of data to the bounce buffer is 
deferred until after the final mapping has been successful. This means 
for writes, we have done the cache flushing before we have actually 
written any data to the buffer.

I don't think it is safe to omit the explicit cache flush for writes in 
this case.

I'll leave it to Geert to decide whether he prefers setting up a 
platform device in arch/m68k/mvme147/config.c or use the shortcut. I've 
used platform_device_register_simple() in a few other drivers so don't 
mind that much.
