Aaaah. That explains a lot! (Not that I can remember what SCSI standard
rev that Areca firmware claimed to implement. I know I never updated the
firmware, so it's going to be something no newer than mid-2009 and
probably quite a bit older.)

It's been up in the loft for years, but I'll get it out this weekend and
give it a spin :) this'll let me make sure the disks still spin as well,
which matters for an in-case-of-lightning-strike disaster-recovery
backup box.

(I just hope this kernel boots on it at all. It's about three years
since I retired it... let's see!)

It's the sort of mistake I could see myself making: an easy mistake to
make when so many things in C require buffer size - 1 or you get a
disastrous security hole...
