As stated in the cover letter:
     "If and when this patchset is accepted, this page will be
      updated:   http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sdebug26.html ".
Doing it before then can lead to confusion if the patchset
is not accepted.

One of my scripts for testing the sg driver uses that pattern
with the cmp replaced by:
     sgh_dd --verify if=/dev/sg1 of=/dev/sg2

The sg_dd utility also has a --verify option and I plan to add
one the the ddpt utility. The pseudo SCSI command sequence that
it performs is:
     PRE-FETCH(sg2, IMMED)
     READ(sg1)
     VERIFY(sg2, BYTCHK=1, data from READ)

Comparing this pattern to the standard READ-READ approach:
   - uses less host CPU and ram resources
   - possibly faster in the inequality case
   - faster if the host does the READ-READ sequentially
