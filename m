Could you explain a bit how you conclude that csio_scsi reset hander has to
use one unique tag? At least we don't allocate request from block layer for
ioctl(SG_SCSI_RESET), see scsi_ioctl_reset(). Also this patch doesn't
use the reserved rq->tag too.

You also don't explain how csio_eh_lun_reset_handler() is broken and where
the ugly hack is in csio scsi too, and how this patch fixes the issue, could
you document the exact reason in the commit log?
