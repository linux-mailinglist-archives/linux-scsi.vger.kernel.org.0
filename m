Well; I'm more of a storage person, and do know the needs and 
shortcomings in that area. Less well so in other areas...

I know. But this essentially is a filter on '/dev' only, and needs to be 
configured. Which makes it very unwieldy to use.
And the contents of sysfs are not modified, so there's a mismatch 
between contents in /dev and /sys.
Which might cause issues with monitoring tools.

I am aware, and that's another reason why device cgroup doesn't cut it.

Which is precisely why I mentioned device modifications.
On a generic level we can influence the visibility of devices in 
relation to namespaces, we cannot influence the devices themselves.
This will lead to namespaces seeing disjunct device numbers (ie 8:0 and 
8:8 on ns 1, 8:4 on ns 2). Not that I think that will be an issue, but 
certainly a change in behaviour.

See above. sysfs modifications and uevent filtering are missing.
This infrastructure for that is already in place thanks to network 
namespaces, we 'just' need to make use of it.
Additional drawback is the manual configuration of device-cgroup.
