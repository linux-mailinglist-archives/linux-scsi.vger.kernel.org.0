Hi James, thank you very much for your answer.

I think we should think about the following functions of megaraid driver:

megasas_complete_cmd() defined in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c,
megasas_complete_cmd
	...
	switch (hdr->cmd) {
	...
	case MFI_CMD_LD_READ:
	case MFI_CMD_LD_WRITE:
		switch (hdr->cmd_status) {
		case MFI_STAT_SCSI_DONE_WITH_ERROR:
			cmd->scmd->result = (DID_OK << 16) | hdr->scsi_status;
			break;
		...
		}
	...
	}

map_cmd_status() defined in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_fusion.c 
map_cmd_status
	...
	switch (status) {
	...
	case MFI_STAT_SCSI_DONE_WITH_ERROR:
		scmd->result = (DID_OK << 16) | ext_status;
		break;
	...
	}

Both of these functions did not check the status byte, which can not make
sure the status byte is defined in SAM.

What we meet is the status byte set to 1, and the host_byte is set to DID_OK.

In this condition, the scsi_cmnd would be finished by scsi middle layer with BLK_STS_OK
if the kernel version is before 3d45cefc8edd7 (scsi: core: Drop obsolete Linux-specific
SCSI status codes).

Because scsi_io_completion_nz_result() would return a non zero value, so we call
scsi_io_completion_action() to handle this command.
While in scsi_io_completion_action(), the blk_stat mapped by scsi_result_to_blk_status()
is BLK_STS_OK which finally result in the command finished with BLK_STS_OK.
