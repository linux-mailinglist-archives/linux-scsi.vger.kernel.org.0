Yeah well pretty much I ended up concluding that even though the driver
*can* be sloppy ultimately we expose tons of knobs through userspace to
easily bump module refcounts at userpace's whim's. For instance a
userspace loop issuing open() on any block driver will bump the module
refcnt. A simple reproducer is provided through korg#214015 [0], see
busy-open-block-device-sleep.c, you run that while running the test
script. In short userspace's simple open() triggers blkdev_open() and
that bumps the module refcnt. This means the module refcnt is finicky.

In so far as a fix is concerned, you have to consider that long ago this
race was considered theoretical, and we had in-kernel support to wait
to get the refcnt to 0 before unloading a module. That code proved
complex, and since the race was theoretical it was removed. The race is
clearly possible with any block driver, and therefore any type of driver
too, and so the fix really is to implement a proper patient module
remover in userspace.

I already implemented and posted patches for kmod for this, they are in
review. In the meantime we have needed to also open code solutions for
fstests and blktest while kmod is not released yet with the new changes.
I already posted patches for both, and fstests has this fix merged a
while ago. Blktests folks just need to finish testing things and merge
the changes.

All that said, drivers can certainly be enhanced to reduce these sorts
of races too. It is all driver specific and so outside of the scope of
generic drivers.
