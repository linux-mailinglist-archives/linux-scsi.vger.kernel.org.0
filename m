I think that's what I said above.  It would give us a bad a priori
value which copying can't help with.

Not if we suspected the device.  I think esas2r does keep the buffer
mapped, but if we suspected the device we'd only map it for the reply
then unmap it.

The point I'm making is we have hardware tools at our disposal to
corral suspect devices if need be, but they're really only used in
exceptional VM circumstances.  Under ordinary circumstances we simply
trust the device.  So if you had evidence that esas2r were prone to
faults, we'd usually force the manufacturer to fix the firmware and as
a last resort we might consider corralling it with an iommu we wouldn't
just copy some values.

If you want an example of defensive coding, we had to add a load of
checks to TPM devices to cope with the bus interposer situation. 
That's one case where we no longer trust the device to return correct
information.  However, to do the same for any SCSI device we'd need a
convincing rationale for why.
