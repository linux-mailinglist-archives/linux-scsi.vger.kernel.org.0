Since we all need this delay here, how about put the delay in the
entrence of ufshcd_setup_clocks(), before vops_setup_clocks()?
If so, we can remove all the delays we added in our vops since the
delay anyways delays everything inside ufshcd_setup_clocks().

Meanwhile, if you want to modify the delay
(hba->dev_info.clk_gating_wait_us) for some reasons, say for specific
UFS devices, you still can do it in vops_apply_dev_quirks().

What do you say?

Thanks,
Can Guo.
