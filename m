[TLDR: I'm adding this report to the list of tracked Linux kernel
regressions; the text you find below is based on a few templates

FWIW, that should have been fae21608c31c ("scsi: mpt3sas: Transition IOC
to Ready state during shutdown") (see reply-to-self from Jerry)

Thanks for the report. To be sure the issue doesn't fall through the
cracks unnoticed, I'm adding it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression
tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced fae21608c31c
#regzbot title scsi: mpt3sas: systems hang at shutdown
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (the parent of this mail). See page linked in footer for
details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
