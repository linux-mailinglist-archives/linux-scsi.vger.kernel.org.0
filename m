I was indeed mostly referring to:

 	c) the portion of the logical unit inventory that consists
 of administrative logical units and hierarchical logical units has
 been changed (see 4.6.18.1); or
 	d) any other event requiring the attention of the SCSI
 initiator device.

The IT nexus status itself might not have changed but if an abstraction
layer representing a totally different set of data that would most
definitely fall under d. I think swapping between a volume and one of
its snapshots also falls under this
