I totally agree with this one but usually it's already reported by
another one (probably the one complaining about misindenting). The
case I've seen quite a few times was:

     while (condition);

At least I want the ';' on its own line to avoid it being
confused with one that ends a do {} while() block.

Hmmm OK for this one. With this said, given how plenty of warnings seem
to consider indent and whatever, I wouldn't be surprised if a difference
is made between a totally empty body and one that results from an empty
macro. But indeed this one can represent a real bug.
