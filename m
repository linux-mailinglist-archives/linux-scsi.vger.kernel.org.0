No matter if ->timeout() is implemented or not, request still may
be timed out, and it is better for block layer to find such issue
and simply reset timer in case of no ->timeout().

timeout timer is reused for idle hctx detection.

Timeout handling is totally decided by driver's ->timeout() callback.
If driver doesn't implement ->timeout(), the request's timer is
reset.
