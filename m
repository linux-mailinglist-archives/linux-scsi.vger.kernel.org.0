Hi Alan,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Testing so far with the 
originally proposed change [0] has not raised any issues and has solved 
the deadlock.

But we have a list of other problems to deal with in the RPM area 
related to the LLDD/libsas, so were waiting to address all of them (or 
at least have a plan) before progressing this change.

One such issue is that when we issue the link-reset which causes the 
device to be lost in the test, the disk is not found again. The customer 
may not be happy with this, so we're investigating solutions.

As for your change itself, I had something similar sitting on our dev 
branch:

[0] 
https://github.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/commit/3696ca85c1e00257c96e40154d28b936742430c4

For me, I'm happy to hold off on any change, but if you think it's 
serious enough to progress your patch, below, now, then I think that 
should be ok.

Thanks,
John
