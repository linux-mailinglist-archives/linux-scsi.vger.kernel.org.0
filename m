I think we are talking about slightly different things. You are coming up with
different possible scenarios where it doesn't work. I get them. You are correct
for those cases. I'm not talking about those cases. I'm talking about the specific
case I described.

I'm saying we have targets where we use backends that get improved performance
when they get batched cmds. When the network is ok, and the user's app is
batching cmds, they come from the app down to the target's backend device as
a batch. My concern is that with your patch we will no longer get that behavior.

The reason is that the target and initiator can do:

1. initiator sends scsi cmd pdu1
2. target sends R2T
3. initiator sees R2T and hits the goto. Sends data
4. target reads in data. Sends cmd to block layer.
5. initiator sends scsi cmd pdu2
6. target sends R2T
7. initiator reads in R2T sends data.
8. target reads in data and sends cmd to block layer.

The problem here could be between 4 and 8 the block layer has run the queue
and sent that one cmd to the real device already because we have that extra
delay now. So when I implemented the fix in the same way as you and I run
iostat I would see lower aqu-sz for example.

With the current code we might not have that extra delay between 4 - 8 so
I would see:

1. initiator sends scsi cmd pdu1
2. initiator sends scsi cmd pdu2
3. initiator sends scsi cmd pdu3
4. target reads in all those cmd pdus
5. target sends R2Ts for each cmd.
6. initiator reads in all the R2Ts
7. initiator sends data for cmd 1 - 3.
8. target reads in data and sends cmd1 to block layer
9. target reads in data and sends cmd2 to block layer
10. target reads in data and sends cmd3 to block layer
11. block layer/iosched hits unplug limit and then sends
those cmds to the real device.

In this case the time between 8 - 9 is small since we are just reading
from the socket, building structs and passing the cmds down to the block
layer. Here when I'm watching the backend device with iostat I see higher
qu-sz values.

Note that you might not be seeing this with LIO for example because we
plug/unplug on every cmd.

When the network is congested, the lun is shared, we are doing retries,
machine gets bogged donw, etc then yeah, we might not get the above behavior.
The user knows this is and it's expected. It's not expected that they just
update the kernel and they get a perf drop in the normal case.

How do we not give these users a regression while fixing the bug?

We are not talking about the same thing. I'm talking about specifically what
a user would do today to boost perf for their app where they have a single app
using the LUN. Single LUN per session. App uses something like fio's batch
args. You have it send down 32 cmds. When those complete, it sends down 32 again.
We are not getting a constant stream or mix of cmds from different sources.

We are not talking about multiple users using the same LUN or even same session.

The user does this. The user has set things up so they are using the device for
their one app. The app is sending down these commands as a batch. No other 
initiators are using the device.

It's *not* say a shared LUN example like we have N VMs on a LUN all doing their
own IO. The user does not expect the same perf for that type of case we they do
when they have specifically tuned their app and device use like I mention.

That's not what I'm talking about. We are not getting a mix like this.

What about a compromise? Instead of doing while (!list_empty). We switch it
to list_for_each and move the requeue handling to infront of the cmdqueue
handling.

We will know that the cmds on the cmdqueue at the time iscsi_data_xmit is run
were sent to us from the block layer at the same time so I get what I need. The
bug is fixed.
