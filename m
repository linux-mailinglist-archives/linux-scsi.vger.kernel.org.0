Yes, you are right, I mixed something up here. Actually, a target
do not MAY not send, it SHALL not send an empty port group:

SPC-4 "6.37 REPORT TARGET PORT GROUPS command":
 The TARGET PORT COUNT field indicates the number of target ports that
are in that target port group and the number of target port descriptors
in the target port group descriptor. Every target port group shall
contain at least one target port. The target port group descriptor
shall include one target port descriptor for each target port in the
target port group.

ESXi is kinda a pain. But fortunately it has nothing to do with that
patch :)
