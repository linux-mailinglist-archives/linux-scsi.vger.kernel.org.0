Hi all-

With regards to our discussion on queue depths, it's common knowledge
that an HDD choses commands from its internal command queue to
optimize performance. The HDD looks at things like the current
actuator position, current media rotational position, power
constraints, command age, etc to choose the best next command to
service. A large number of commands in the queue gives the HDD a
better selection of commands from which to choose to maximize
throughput/IOPS/etc but at the expense of the added latency due to
commands sitting in the queue.

NVMe doesn't allow us to pull commands randomly from the SQ, so the
HDD should attempt to fill its internal queue from the various SQs,
according to the SQ servicing policy, so it can have a large number of
commands to choose from for its internal command processing
optimization.

It seems to me that the host would want to limit the total number of
outstanding commands to an NVMe HDD for the same latency reasons they
are frequently limited today. If we assume the HDD would have a
relatively deep (perhaps 256) internal queue (which is deeper than
most latency-sensitive customers would want to run) then the SQ would
be empty most of the time. To me it seems that only when the host's
number of outstanding commands fell below the threshold should the
host add commands to the SQ. Since the drive internal command queue
would not be full, the HDD would immediately pull the commands from
the SQ and put them into its internal command queue.

I can't think of any advantage to running a deep SQ in this scenario.

When the host requests to delete a SQ the HDD should abort the
commands it is holding in its internal queue that came from the SQ to
be deleted, then delete the SQ.

Best regards,
-Tim
