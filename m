Hi Christoph,

Thanks for your comments. Sorry for replying late since I was in
vacation.

Actually it is a SCSI driver, and it does register a scsi_host_template
and host does send SCSI commands to our raid controller just like other
raid controllers. 
You are right "it looks a lot like NVMe" since we believe the
communication mechanism of NVME between host and the end device is good
and it was leveraged when we designed the raid controller. That's why
it looks like there are some code from NVME because the mechanism is
the same.
