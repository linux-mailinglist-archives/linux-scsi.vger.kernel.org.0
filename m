Hi Hannes,

Isn't every driver that defines a struct scsi_host_template by definition a
SCSI driver?

If there is enough code that is shared between the spraid driver and the NVMe
core one could look into creating a library with the shared code. However,
I'm not sure this is worth the effort nor that the NVMe maintainers will
agree with this.

Thanks,

Bart.
