Not sure if that's worth it.

What is far more pressing is a _real_ scsi device rescan, ie the 
possibility of the scsi device changing its inquiry data upon rescan.
At this time the inquiry data is essentially frozen, and the only way to 
handle this is to remove the device and rescan everything
(scsi-rescan-bus.sh -r ...).
It would far better if we could just issue a rescan and the scsi core 
would detect the change internally without the need to recreate the 
object itself.

Cheers,

Hannes
