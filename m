You're starting to think along the right lines, but you are ignoring all 
the other work that people have already done for handling these cases.

Please read Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst very carefully, 
especially the parts about returning a positive value from the ->prepare 
callback (also known as "direct-complete" and related to the 
DPM_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE and DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE flags) and the 
parts about the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND and DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME 
flags.  Then think about what you want to accomplish and write a patch 
that takes all this information into account.

Key point: At no time should any part of the kernel think that the 
device is in a low-power state when it is actually in a high-power 
state, or vice versa.
