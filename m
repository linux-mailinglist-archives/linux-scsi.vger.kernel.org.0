The question I asked you was intended to make you think. I wasn't asking 
you to search MAINTAINERS for "drivers/target" (I had already done so).

Chris, you can find my name in that file too. That's because I see my role 
as custodian of that particular code. That code lives in the kernel.org 
tree because others put it there and because users find it useful -- not 
merely because it happens to please the official glorious MAINTAINER of 
said code.

If you would ask, "who's call is it to delete drivers/nubus? or 
drivers/scsi/NCR5380.c?" my answer is, I have no idea.

Martin said, "I'd appreciate a patch to remove it"

And Bart said, "do you want to keep this driver in the kernel tree?"

AFAICT both comments are quite ambiguous. I don't see an actionable 
request, just an expression of interest from people doing their jobs.

Note well: there is no pay check associated with having a MAINTAINERS file 
entry.
