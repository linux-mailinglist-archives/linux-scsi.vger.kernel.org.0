Potentially, it is. The difference is that so far no one ever complained
about it, while with namespace async scanning we immediately received regre=
ssion
reports, to the point we had to revert the changes and restore the
sequential namespaces scan in RHEL.

Ok, so you'd like to use the namespace's NSID as the suffix.
I also considered this approach, the reason I didn't implemented
it is that I wished to have the async namespace scan performance improvemen=
ts
while preserving the same enumeration we had for years with the sequential =
scan:

Before the introduction of the async scan, /dev/nvme0n1 always pointed
to the first entry of the NSID list, /dev/nvme0n2 to the second
entry and so on.

With your proposal, if a user has sparse NSIDs (1, 10, 333)
then he will get /dev/nvme0n1, /dev/nvme0n10, /dev/nvme0n333.
On one hand, yes, they are "more stable" and more meaningful too,
on the other hand this breaks the assumption of contiguous naming.
This might not be a problem for the mainline kernel, but I suspect we
will have people complaining again that the /dev/nvmeXnY enumeration change=
