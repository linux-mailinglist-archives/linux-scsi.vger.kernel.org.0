To be honest, I don't care much about this driver, but when it fails here,
it stops build tests.

The Makefile passes -Werror from external flags to some but not other
invocations of the compiler; those spew warnings but don't cause the build
to fail.

Obviously, if we wanted to polish the driver it'd be nice to fix those
warnings, but as I mentioned above that's currently not my itch to scratch.
