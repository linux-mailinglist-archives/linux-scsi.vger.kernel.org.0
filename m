Subject: [RESEND PATCH v2] scsi: core: Change function comments to kernel-doc style
Date:   Mon,  6 Jan 2020 15:12:14 -0300
Message-Id: <20200106181214.86249-1-andrealmeid@collabora.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.24.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Sender: linux-scsi-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-scsi.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org

Despite of functions being documented, they are not in the kernel-doc
specification, and could not be included in kernel documentation. Change
the style of functions comments to be compliant to the kernel-doc style.
When the function comment is outdated, update then.

Hello,

This v2 is from a commit originally from this serie:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11141867/

This patched was tested with kernel-doc script and the HTML output was
verified as well.

Thanks,
	André

Changes from v1:
- Update "midlevel queue" to "scheduler queue". This seems to be the
correct term after following the call stack until reach a call to
blk_mq_sched_requeue_request().
- Update names of functions at scsi_io_completion() comment.
- Remove duplicated comment at scsi_io_completion().
