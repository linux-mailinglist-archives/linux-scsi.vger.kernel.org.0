Hannes,

Earlier you mentioned " some drivers not only the command needs a tag, 
but the sgls also, thereby completely messing up our mq tags logic.
So to map those we'd need to allocate _several_ tags for one command ..."

Which drivers are these? Can you provide a pointer? Is this the blocker?

Thanks,
John
