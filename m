I can imagine how using poll(2) would work from a userspace perspective,
but on the kernel side I don't think it can be implemented cleanly.
poll(2) is tied to the file_operations->poll() callback and
read/write/error events. Not to mention there isn't a way to substitue
the vhost worker thread function instead of scheduling out the current
thread while waiting for poll fd events.

But maybe ioctl(VHOST_WORKER_RUN) can do it:

  struct vhost_run_worker_dev {
      int vhostfd;      /* /dev/vhost-TYPE fd */
      unsigned nvqs;    /* number of virtqueues in vqs[] */
      unsigned vqs[];   /* virtqueues to process */
  };

  struct vhost_run_worker_info {
       struct timespec *timeout;
       sigset_t *sigmask;

       unsigned ndevices;
       struct vhost_run_worker_dev *devices[];
  };

In the simple case userspace sets ndevices to 1 and we just handle
virtqueues for the current device.

In the fancier shared worker thread case the userspace process has the
vhost fds of all the devices it is processing and passes them to
ioctl(VHOST_WORKER_RUN) via struct vhost_run_worker_dev elements.

From a security perspective it means the userspace thread has access to
all vhost devices (because it has their fds).

I'm not sure how the mm is supposed to work. The devices might be
associated with different userspace processes (guests) and therefore
have different virtual memory.

Just wanted to push this discussion along a little further. I'm buried
under emails and probably wont be very active over the next few days.
