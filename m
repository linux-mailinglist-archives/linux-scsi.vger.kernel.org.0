Update lpfc to revision 14.2.0.0

This patch set is a refactoring of the lpfc driver.

The lpfc driver was first implemented for sli-3 then had sli-4 added
to it. The addition of sli-4 was done in a manner where the sli-3 paths
were left in place with sli-3 structures converted to sli-4 when written
to the adapter. Similar behavior for responses. Over time we've been hit
with subtle sli3 vs sli4 structure formats issues, bits defined on sli3
that aren't on sli4 or vice versa, that the driver wasn't careful about.
The subtleties caused bogus settings to be passed when the eventually
overlapped, or expected values that never we set by the hw.

Given that all sli-3 hardware is now end of life (last sli3 adapter is 
~10 yrs old) we'd like to move the implementation of the driver such that
it uses sli-4 as its native path and kills the "translation" layer. Sli-3
is still supported, but we're trying to move away from the sli-3 data
structures that dominated the implementation and instead move to a more
generic structure, and hopefully do so without huge amounts of code change
for what in some respects would be naming deltas.

This patch refactors the driver to make the fast and slow paths now work
on native sli-4 datastructures. Common areas or items change their names
to make it clear they aren't sli-3 centric. Generic access functions to
get/set common fields were created abstract the structure deltas. The
different code paths were then reworked to use the generic names/routines
and where rev-specific data was to be set, add explicit sections to set
the items based on the revision. In this way, no translation occurs and
any rev-spec delta is very clear.  In performing this, some of the
checking or case logic varied a little, and some code cleanups were
performed.

The patches were cut against Martin's 5.17/scsi-fixes tree
