Hi Hannes,

I agree that reordering is not an issue for NVMe zone append commands.
It is an issue however with SCSI devices because there is no zone append
command in the SCSI command set. The sd_zbc.c code translates zone
appends (REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND) into regular WRITE commands. If these WRITE
commands are reordered, the ZBC standard requires that these commands
fail with an UNALIGNED WRITE error. So I think for SCSI devices what you
wrote is wrong.

Bart.
