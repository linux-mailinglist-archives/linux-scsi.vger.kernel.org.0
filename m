Subject: [PATCH v11 00/44] sg: add v4 interface
Date:   Wed, 14 Oct 2020 22:05:59 -0400

This patchset is the first stage of a two stage rewrite of the scsi
generic (sg) driver. The main goal of the first stage is to introduce
the sg v4 interface that uses 'struct sg_io_v4' as well as keeping and
modernizing the sg v3 interface (based on 'struct sg_io_hdr'). The
async interface formerly requiring the use of write() and read()
system calls now have ioctl(SG_IOSUBMIT) and ioctl(SG_IORECEIVE)
replacements. See:
    http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg_v40.html
for more details. If accessing http pages is a problem, a temporary
rendering of this page can be found here:

This patchset is against Martin Petersen's 5.10/scsi-queue branch.

Changes since v10 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20200823)
  - unchanged: 0001 to 0009, 0010 to 0017
  - rename sg_add_req() to sg_setup_req() [0010]
  - patches 40,41,42 and 43 are new, see their commit messages
  - remove SG_RS_RCV_DONE request state leaving 3.5 states
    [the 0.5 state is SG_RS_BUSY]
  - rework sg_rq_chg_state() code that enforces request
    state changes and associated xarray marks
  - track lowest used and unused indexes in the request arrays so
    iterations over the request xarray are efficient. This is a
    significant saving when the iodepth queue length is large

Changes since v9 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20200421)
  - rebase on MKP's 5.10/scsi-queue branch
  - remove some master/slave terminology that had bled in from
    the part 2 patchset
  - change sg_request::start_ns type from ktime_t to u64
  - pick up several error path correction fixes applied to the
    sg driver by other authors

Changes since v8 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20200301)
  - add new patch to ignore the /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio setting.
    Now direct IO will be attempted whenever the SG_FLAG_DIRECT_IO
    flag is given
  - add new patch to track mmap_sz from previous mmap() call.
    Allows catching mmap-ed requests that exceed that value
  - change warning about using the v3 interface with the write()
    system call from WARN_ONCE() to pr_warn_once()
  - remove __KERNEL__ conditionals in include/scsi/sg.h
  - change struct sg_fd::start_ns from u64 to ktime_t type
  - introduce a new small sg_rq_state_mul2arr array to avoid
    a multiplication at runtime in the state machine engine
  - tweak mempool introduced in v7 for sense buffers
  - rework sg_mk_sgat() to better handle low memory situations;
    similar work on sg_remove_sgat_helper()

Changes since v7 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20200227)
  - improve direct IO code, remove the SG_FRQ_DIO_IN_USE
    sg_request::frq_bm flag as it is no longer needed
  - simplify state changing code. Many state changes (rq_st) do not
    need changes to the xarray "marks"; only lock those that do
    (reviewer queried the locking)
  - remove some misplaced likely()/unlikely() macros. They are gathered
    together in a separate patch (in a second patchset)
  - change a cast that the kbuild robot complained about. It also
    flagged a stack size problem in sg_ioctl_common() for reasons not
    given nor obvious. That function (and its parents) declare only
    simple scalars on the stack.
  - add 'Reviewed-by' where appropriate

Changes since v6 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20200112)
  - based on Martin Petersen's 5.7/scsi-queue branch in his
    linux-scsi repository
  - major work on mmap support: when mmap(2) is used the reserve
    request scatter gather list is rebuilt to have order=0
    elements (i.e. each is PAGE_SIZE bytes).
  - address one kbuild robot issue: add include defining size_t
  - nearly all patches that have been reviewed have been changed,
    usually in minor ways. Those patches have "***" before the
    "Reviewed-by" line.
