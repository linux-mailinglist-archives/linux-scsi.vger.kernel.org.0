Rodrigo,

I pushed the resume-v2 branch to libata tree:

git@gitolite.kernel.org:pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dlemoal/libata
(or https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dlemoal/libata.git)

This branch adds 13 patches on top of 6.5.0 to cleanup libata suspend/resume and
other device shutdown issues. The first 4 patches are the main ones to fix
suspend resume. I tested that on 2 different machines with different drives and
with qemu. All seems fine.

Could you try to run this through your CI ? I am very interested in seeing if it
survives your suspend/resume tests.

If you can confirm that all issues are fixed, I will rebase this on for-next and
post.

Thanks !
