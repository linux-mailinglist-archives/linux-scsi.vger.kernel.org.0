There are two cases that there are no SG devices and SG_IO cannot work.
1. To access raid controller: 
a. Raid controller is a scsi host, not a scsi device, so there
is no SG device associated with it. 
b. Even there is a scsi device for raid controller, SG_IO
cannot work when something wrong with IO queue and only admin queue can
work;
2. To access the physical disks behinds raid controller: 
raid controller only reports VDs to OS and only VDs have SG devices. OS
has no idea about physical disks behinds raid controller and there is no
SG devices associated with physical disks.

Since there are not much examples in include/uapi/scsi/, what' your
suggestion on how to put the definitions into the folder? for example,
what's the file name? spraid_ioctrl.h?
