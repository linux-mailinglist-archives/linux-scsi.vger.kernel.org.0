Hi Vinod,

If you are using the 8998's DT present on upstream, you may also need to 
enable
device reset on your platform. (We usually do a device reset before call 
ufshcd_hba_enable())
Given that 845 works fine, it may be the difference you have with 845. 
845 has device
reset support ready in upstream code, you can check sdm845-mtp.dts.
It is same for 8150, which is a lack of device reset support in upstream 
code base.

To enable UFS device reset, please see
1. 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20190828191756.24312-4-bjorn.andersson@linaro.org/
2. 53a5372ce326116f3e3d3f1d701113b2542509f4

FYI, I tested the patch on 8250 and its family platforms. In my build, I 
ported
change in #2 to my code base (in your case, make change to
drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-msm8998.c) and enable the GPIO in DT like 
sdm845-mtp.dts

         reset-gpios = <&tlmm 150 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

Thanks
