Yes about the IDENTIFY command. But exactly as you said, some drives have
metadata on the media and will not report everything, or we outright not like
receiving an IDENTIFY command while spun down (I have a couple of these odd
clown drives in my collection).

However, regarding the SET FEATURES command to spin up the drive, you are
confusing the basic power management (STANDBY IMMEDIATE command support), which
is a mandatory feature of ATA disks, with the Extended Power Conditions (EPC)
feature set, which is optional. The latter one defines the behavior of the SET
FEATURES command with the Extended Power Conditions subcommand to control the
disk power state and power state transitions timers. The former, basic power
management, does NOT have this. So trying what you suggest would only work for
drives that support and enable EPC. Given that EPC is optional, and that we are
not probing/supporting it currently in libata, we cannot rely on that.

That already is all taken care of. That is the basics for even the initial scan
on boot where we send commands to the disk while it is still spinning up. The
timeout I am mentioning is the drive not responding at all because it is spun
down, no matter how many times one retries. And given that the ATA specs clearly
define that a drive should not change its power state with a reset, even the
reset after the command timeout does not change anything with some drives (I do
have some drives that actually spin up on reset, but many that don't, as per spec).

Exactly. As you said yourself, there are some drives that will not report
everything unless they are spun up. And I have some old drives that really do
not like receiving that command at all while spun down. So the safer approach
taken is to spinup the drive upfront, before doing anything else.

PUIS is another optional feature that we do not directly support in the kernel.
If you want/need that, patches are welcome. With detection of that feature
added, we could improve resume and avoid useless drive spinup. That is currently
outside the scope of this series since we are not supporting PUIS currently.
