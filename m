Any Power 9 or older generation PowerVM based system would have an IPR installed as the boot device.
Additionally, on Power 10 systems, ipr SAS controllers are available as an add in card. 

However, the SATA support in ipr was only used to attach the onboard SATA DVD. Power 8 systems were
the last generation of systems that had an onboard SATA DVD. So, to do any testing with a
SATA DVD, you'd need a Power 8 or older system. 

Right now I have a patch that removes the SATA support from ipr completely and a patch that changes
to use the error_handler libata support. The one that changes to use the error_handler libata API
adds a bit of complexity for a function that should have few or no users that would need this support
on a current upstream kernel, since only Power 8 and older systems use this support. I'm getting
a system setup to try out both patches, but at this point I'm leaning towards the patch that
removes the libata dependency from ipr.

Thanks,

Brian
