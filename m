Hi Martin,

My understanding of commit f45bca8c5052 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix double
scsi_done for abort path") is as follows:
* A long time ago a scsi_done() call was introduced in
qla2xxx_eh_abort(). Maybe this commit introduced that call: 083a469db4ec
("[SCSI] qla2xxx: Correct use-after-free oops seen during EH-abort.").
* Calling scsi_done() from qla2xxx_eh_abort() is only fine if the
firmware does not report a completion after having processed an abort
request. My conclusion from commit f45bca8c5052 is that the firmware
does report a completion after having processed an abort request. Hence
the removal of that scsi_done call from qla2xxx_eh_abort().

Bart.
