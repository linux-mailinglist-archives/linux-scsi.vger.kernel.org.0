Huh, that's ugly. The issue is that the device that deals with the
interrupts isn't the device that the ITS knows about (there isn't a
1:1 mapping between mbigen and the endpoint).

The mbigen is responsible for the creation of the corresponding
irqdomain, and and crucially for the "prepare" phase, which results
in storing the its_dev pointer in info->scratchpad[0].

As we free all the interrupts associated with the endpoint, we
free the its_dev (nothing else needs it at this point). On the
next allocation, we reuse the damn its_dev pointer, and we're SOL.
This is wrong, because we haven't removed the mbigen, only the
device *connected* to the mbigen. And since the mbigen can be shared
across endpoints, we can't reliably tear it down at all. Boo.

The only thing to do is to convey that by marking the its_dev as
shared so that it isn't deleted when no LPIs are being used. After
all, it isn't like the mbigen is going anywhere.

It is just that passing that information down isn't a simple affair,
as msi_alloc_info_t isn't a generic type... Let me have a think.
