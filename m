AFAIK, trusted and encrypted keys are generally loaded from initramfs
(as an encrypted blob) which happens during boot and if an attacker is
able to erase initramfs then it's already able to make the device
non-bootable (DoS attack which is hard to prevent against).

Although, I agree with you that fuses are the preferred way to store
RPMB key but not every platform may possess it and vendors may decide
to re-flash a bricked device via recovery image.

Agree and via DT method I only meant to assign already provisioned
RPMB device/s either to TEE or Linux kernel. And RPMB key provisioning
being a one time process should be carried out carefully during device
manufacturing only.
