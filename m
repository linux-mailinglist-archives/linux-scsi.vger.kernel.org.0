There is already an enable semantic. It is pg_pt_gp_id field. Until it
(id) is not set the port group is treated as disabled and it is not
reported in RTPG. But the default_tg_pt_gp is enabled by default and can
not be deleted.

The patch solves the presence of non-deletable empty default_tg_pt_gp
in RTPG.
May be, a global attribute like target/core/alua/hide_emtpy_tpg would
fit better than an attribute per each port group?

I would always hide the empty default_lu_gp (not configurable) but I am
afraid that it will be considered as not backward compatible change. :(
