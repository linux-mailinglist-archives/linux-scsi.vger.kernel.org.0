OK, and then it doesn't trigger again? It's key that it keeps doing this
timeout and re-dispatch if it fails, not just once.

But BFQ really should be smarter here. It's the same caller etc that
asks whether it has work and whether it can dispatch, yet the answer is
different. That's just kind of silly, and it'd make more sense if BFQ
actually implemented the ->has_work() as a "would I actually dispatch
for this guy, now".

We obviously have to be careful not to introduce a busy-loop, where we
just keep scheduling dispatch, only to fail.
