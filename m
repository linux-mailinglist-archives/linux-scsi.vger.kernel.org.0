But what makes 'zero_pages' special as compared to, say, WRITE_SAME?
One could use WRITE SAME with '0' content, arriving at pretty much the 
same content than usine zeroout without unmapping. And neither of them 
worries about cache flushing.
Nor should they, IMO.

These are 'native' block layer calls, providing abstract accesses to 
hardware functionality. If an application wants to use them, it would be 
the task of the application to insert a 'flush' if it deems neccessary.
(There _is_ blkdev_issue_flush(), after all).

Cheers,

Hannes
