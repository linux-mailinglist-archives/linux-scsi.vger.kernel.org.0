Sorry, my last response was not very clear. I was referring to reply
queues as HW queues
not submission queues. I agree with you, since megaraid_sas HW has
single submission
queue so >1 HW queue would not help to improve performance. Testing
done by us on shared
tagset patches worked by you/Hannes was to ensure no performance drop
from single HW
submission queue based driver.

"megaraid_sas" driver would be benefited with draining of IO
completions directed to
hotplugged(offlined) CPU. With current driver IO completion would
hang, if CPU on which IO is to be
completed goes offline.
