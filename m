If I understand you, then the answer is vhost scsi has a setting 
num_queues already that controls the number of vqs. The upstream 
kernel's vhost scsi driver and qemu's vhost scsi code support multiqueue 
today. To enable it, the admin is setting the qemu property num_queues 
(qemu/hw/scsi/host-scsi.c). In the current code, we are already doing 
what I described in "Today we do:".

In the second chunk of patches (patches 13 - 16) I'm just trying to make 
it so vhost-scsi gets a thread per IO vq.

Patch 17 then fixes up the cgroup support so the user can control the IO 
vqs with cgroups. Today for vhost scsi the vhost work thread takes the 
request from the vq, then passes it to a workqueue_struct workqueue to 
submit it to the block layer. So today we are putting the vhost work 
thread in the cgroup, but it's a different thread interacting with the 
block layer, and the cgroup settings/limits are not applying.
