Apologies for the delay in the reply, but over the
time to address Chris' two questions about this patch set. See below.

I talked to Chris a bit about this offline, for clarification. I believe I
understand his concern, and rather than try to assert the patch is
ok by inspection, I decided to just test it.

Turns out that normal PDU traffic for lots of writes generally
includes "immediate data", and so it was easy to test this.

Testing showed that Immediate Data still works correctly,
in SCSI Write PDUs. Test was:
* connect to an iSCSI target
* Write a bunch of data
* read back the data
* disconnect from target and compare data

In addition, I captured and analyzed the SCSI/iSCSI tcpdump trace,
and immediate data was present, as expected.

One co-worker ran a similar test (just the SCSI/iSCSI trace part),
and found the same results.

I looked at the code and the SPEC in more detail, and I believe the answer
is "yes", it is correct.

That function checks the current PDU's sequence number with
the following tests (and side effects), but not in this order:
* check that seq# is not larger than maximum
* check that seq# is not larger than expected
* check that seq# is not smaller than expected
* else the seq# is correct, so *SIDE* *EFFECT* increment the
                                               expected seq# for next PDU

It turns out that the SPEC allow the sequence number to be
out of range for immediate commands! So none of the checks
in iscsit_sequence_check_received_cmndsn() are valid for
immediate commands, as far as I can see.
