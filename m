Subject: [PATCH] Replace HTTP links with HTTPS ones: AHA152X SCSI driver
Date:   Sun,  5 Jul 2020 23:44:42 +0200

Sender: linux-scsi-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-scsi.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org

Rationale:
Reduces attack surface on kernel devs opening the links for MITM
as HTTPS traffic is much harder to manipulate.

Deterministic algorithm:
For each file:
  If not .svg:
    For each line:
      If doesn't contain `\bxmlns\b`:
        For each link, `\bhttp://[^# \t\r\n]*(?:\w|/)`:
          If both the HTTP and HTTPS versions
          return 200 OK and serve the same content:
            Replace HTTP with HTTPS.

 If there are any URLs to be removed completely or at least not HTTPSified:
 Just clearly say so and I'll *undo my change*.
