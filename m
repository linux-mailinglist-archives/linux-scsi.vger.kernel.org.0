Hi Kbuild,
Both of us have something to improve. I should fix my code, but it
was correct before you told me to fix it last time!

The change that caused this error is on line 35 of include/uapi/scsi/sg.h:
     #include <uapi/linux/bsg.h>

which is indeed incorrect since no other header under include/uapi
has "uapi" in the path of one of its embedded includes. So the rule seems
to be that header files under the uapi directory implicitly refer to
other headers under the uapi directory when they "#include <filename>".

However the change in my code was a result of this kbuild report from
version 2 of this patchset:
    https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg132432.html

And that earlier error report seems incorrect and indicates that your
build tree is misconfigured with respect to this directory:
     include/uapi/scsi/

The failure shown in msg132432.html indicates that when your tree resolved
this line in include/uapi/scsi/sg.h :
     #include <linux/bsg.h>

that it incorrectly included
     include/linux/bsg.h
instead of
     include/uapi/linux/bsg.h

If you concur and fix this issue, kindly add the following tag
