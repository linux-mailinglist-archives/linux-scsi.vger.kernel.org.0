No, I am not sure. I thought this was a DMA case (I'm not a SCSI Tape user,
so it *seemed* reasonable that a DMA engine was involved), but if it's really
direct IO, then we need to just drop this patch entirely. Because: I need to
convert the block/biovec code, including iov_iter_get_pages_alloc() and
friends, in order to handle direct IO. I'm working on that but it's not
ready yet.

(I was trying to get the smaller, non-direct-IO cases converted first.)

Thanks for spotting the discrepancy, and apologies for the confusion on this
end.

Also, I doubt if it's worth it, but do you want a patch to change SetPageDirty()
to set_page_dirty_lock(), meanwhile? It seems like if that's never come up, then
it's mostly a theoretical bug.

thanks,
