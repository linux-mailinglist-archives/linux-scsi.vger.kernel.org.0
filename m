Thinking of further, actually almost all soft update in ->store()
needn't to freeze queue:

- all are scalar update 

- we can guarantee the new value is correct by validating first, so both
new val and old val are correct from device viewpoint

- the freeze is added recently in v6.11 af2814149883 ("block: freeze the queue
in queue_attr_store") for addressing nothing

Not mention sd_revalidate_disk() can be called in sd_open() without queue
freeze.

But update from hardware need queue to be frozen, or doing that before
disk is up.

My idea is to try to cut the lock chain, and your approach is to try to
order everything. From lock dependency viewpoint, it is simpler to
avoid the dependency from beginning because it is too complicated to
order everything.

Here block layer API isn't involved, since block layer doesn't or can't
provide API to update single field of queue_limits.

Also the shadow sd_limits can be thought as one scsi's own hardware property
abstract, and its name just follows block layer queue's limits for the
sake of simplicity.

Long term, block layer may do similar categorization for queue_limits
according to function, then scsi disk's shadow structure can be removed
if scsi doesn't have special requirement.
