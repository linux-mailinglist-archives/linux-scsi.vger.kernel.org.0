I beg to disagree. Path groups are nominally independent, and might
change states independent on the other path groups.
While for some arrays a 'transitioning' state is indeed system-wide,
other arrays might be able to serve I/O on other paths whilst one is in
transitioning.
So I'd rather not presume anything here.

Oh, I know _that_ one. What with me being one of the implementors asking
for it :-)

But again, this is _per path_. One cannot assume anything about _other_
paths here.

No. The implicit transitioning timeout is used to determine for how long
we will be sending a 'TEST UNIT READY'/'REPORT TARGET PORT GROUPS' combo
to figure out if this particular path is still in transitioning. Once
this timeout is exceeded we're setting the path to 'standby'.
And this 'setting port to standby' is our action for 'timing out an
implicit state transition' as defined by the spec.

And that is precisely what I want to avoid.

As outlined above, we cannot assume that all paths will be set to
'transitioning' once we hit the 'transitioning' condition on one path.
As such, we need to retry the I/O on other paths, to ensure failover
does work in these cases. Hence it's perfectly okay to set this path to
'failed' as we cannot currently send I/O to that path.

If, however, we are hitting a 'transitioning' status on _all_ paths (ie
all paths are set to 'failed') we need to ensure that we do _not_ fail
the I/O (as technically the paths are still alive), but retry with
TUR/RTPG until one path reaches a final state.
Then we should reinstate that path and continue with I/O.

I thought that this is what we do already; but might be that there are
some issues lurking here.

So what is the error you are seeing?

Cheers,

Hannes
