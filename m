Hi James,

Looking structures like struct cmd_entry, mrk_entry, ecmd_entry, lun 
member is an 8-bit value. There is also this definition:
#define MAX_LUNS	8	/* 32 */
#define MAX_L_BITS	3	/* 5 */

But not sure on where 32/5 comes from - I suppose it's the size the 
driver uses to hold the lun. Or the 32 bits you mention.

SCSI_LUN_32 is used outside the masked debug code, so I didn't want to 
mess with that.

If a relevant scsi_device member really hold values > 32b in size for 
this driver then it's in trouble, as chopping off the top bits by 
casting won't help.

And if we only ever expect the bottom 32b to be used, using %lld as 
opposed to casting to an int and using %i should not really make a 
difference.

Anyway, I can change as you suggest. But I would rather do it only in 
SCSI_LUN_32().

Thanks!
