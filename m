Given the age of the current implementation, what suddenly broke that
requires this to change at this point in time?

I can't understand what you are trying to do here.

What do you want to represent in sysfs with a symlink that you can't
just have in a single sysfs file like "name" or "new_name" or
"name_because_we_didnt_think_about_this_10_years_ago" that shows you the
other "name" that you are trying to look up here?

Why abuse symlinks like this at all?

And no, the device.h and core.c changes aren't ok :)
