The only place I see where that flag might get set is in 
blk_mq_bio_to_request() in block/blk-mq.c, which does:

	if (bio->bi_opf & REQ_RAHEAD)
		rq->cmd_flags |= REQ_FAILFAST_MASK;

So apparently read-ahead reads are supposed to fail fast (i.e., without 
retries), presumably because they are optional after all.

Yes, 0x28 is READ(10).  Likely this is a read-ahead request, although I 
don't know how we can tell for sure.

Is such a drastic response really appropriate for the failure of a 
read-ahead request?  It seems like a more logical response would be to 
let the request fail but keep the device online.

Of course, that would only solve part of your problem -- your log would 
still get filled with those "I/O error" messages even though they 
wouldn't be fatal.  Probably a better approach would be to make the new 
expecting_media_change flag override scsi_no_retry_cmd().

But this is not my area of expertise.  Maybe someone else will have more 
to say.
