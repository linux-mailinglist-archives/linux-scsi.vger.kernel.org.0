Sorry, I don't understand what your point is supposed to be here.  It's
certainly not okay to leave the long-term wrapped key in memory, since that
destroys the security properties of hardware-wrapped keys.  So we need to
provide an API that makes it possible for the long-term wrapped key to be
zeroized.  The API you're proposing, as I understand it, wouldn't allow for that
because the long-term wrapped key would remain in memory as long as the keyring
service key exists, even when only the ephemerally-wrapped key is needed.

But in that case all the proposed new BLKCRYPTO* ioctls are still needed.  Your
suggestion would just make them harder to use by requiring users to copy their
key into a keyrings service key instead of just providing it directly in the
ioctl.

That mustn't happen here, since finding out in the middle of an I/O request that
inline encryption isn't supported is too late.  That's what the crypto
capabilities in struct blk_crypto_profile are for -- to allow users to check
what is supported before trying to use it.

It's not "misbehaving" -- it's just an example of a system that configures the
encryption centrally, which is common.  (And the reason I brought up that the
module parameter works for Android is because you claimed it wouldn't.)

Again, needing a module parameter is unfortunate but I don't see any realistic
way around it for these Qualcomm SoCs.
