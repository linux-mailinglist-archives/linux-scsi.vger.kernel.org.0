I've seen the kernel crash because of this breakout. A crash happens if
another code path was blocked because of either the stopped FW or
anything else, and would time out after this code. 

The actual crash I've seen is already been fixed by patch 1 of this
series, because qla2x00_terminate_rport_io() checks UNLOADING before
sending IO. So if it was just about that, we could keep the breakout.

I suspect that the "unbound sleep" occurred only because of the 
hanging access to stopped FW (note that c3b6a1d39742 was made just ~2
months after 45235022da99 "scsi: qla2xxx: Fix driver unload by shutting
down chip"). If that's true, the hang wouldn't occur any more with
patch 1-2 of my series applied. If it's wrong and the hang does occur
again, IMO we should find out what is hanging, and fix it, rather than
blindly quit this wait loop and free resources.

But if you want to keep it in, I'm not going to insist; I'm more
interested in getting the first two patches merged.

Regards,
Martin

(Btw, I suppose you'll admit the combination of msleep() and counting
isn't the state of the art of implementing a timeout in the kernel).
