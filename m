Yes, agree.

There is also some funky logic going on with all this:
ATA_DFLAG_PIO meaning "PIO supported" should always be set for NCQ drives,
because NCQ drives necessarily can do DMA and so they can do PIO as well...
So patterns like:

dev->flags & (ATA_DFLAG_PIO | ATA_DFLAG_NCQ |
		ATA_DFLAG_NCQ_OFF)) == ATA_DFLAG_NCQ

To test if NCQ is supported does not really make any sense... Example:
ata_scsi_security_inout_xlat() has:

bool dma = !(qc->dev->flags & ATA_DFLAG_PIO);

Sure... That works, but that is not technically super correct has a DMA capable
drive can do PIO as well.

I think we are dealing with ata history here as everything was "PIO" at the
beginning of ata times, so that flag did not really needed to exist and was
added later to differentiate with NCQ case.

Splitting the gigantic enum in include/linux/libata.h into manageable pieces
(e.g. "enum ata_device_flags { ... };") with some renaming and better kdocs
would help clarifies things. Will try to work on that.
