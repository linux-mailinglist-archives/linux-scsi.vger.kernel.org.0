The definition of scsi_send_eh_cmnd() is broken, obviously it doesn't
change the cdb of the passed argument. However I don't want to use
the const incorrectness of the existing code to avoid const in
the code I added. So retrofitting needs casts.

Because I don't want to change that function's interface, just point out
how it is broken.

Yes, probably a scsi_cmnd_get_changeable_cdb() function which is safe as
long as the new cdb_len <= the existing cdb_len . I think it's the only
occasion I did that due to the cdb[1] overwrite in the lun_in_cdb case
(i.e. SCSI-2 SPI).

Well that was the way it was before the surgery performed by Christoph.
If reducing the size of the scsi_cmnd structure by another 16 bytes
is that important, it can be easily done. My "long cdb" side of the
union takes 16 bytes currently (12 on a 32 bit machine).


IMO there should be comments added to scsi_cmnd.h to stress an object
of that type is always preceded (in memory) by a struct request object.
They are created as a pair, and are destroyed (freed, destructed) as
a pair.
