Yes, that was also my review comments.

So what are useful APIs we can/should expose?.

If we want full portability we can't support all the individual checks,
because the disk will check it for SCSI even if we don't do the extra
checks in the controller.  We could still expose the invidual
flags, but reuse the combinations SCSI doesn't support on SCSI,
although that would lead to surprises if people write their software
and test on NVMe and then move to SCSI.  Could we just expose the
valid SCSI combinations if people are find with that for now?

Note that these reads aren't readaheads (well, they actually are too
because everything in the buffer cache does a readahead first), but
probing reads from blkid / partitions scans / etc.  Right now the
driver has not way to distinguish them for reads that are really looking
for (meta-)data that is expected to be there.

I'm not currently seeing warnings on SCSI, but that's because my only
PI testing is scsi_debug which starts out with deallocated blocks.
