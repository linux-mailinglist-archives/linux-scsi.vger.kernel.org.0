--- Comment #7 from Dieter Mummenschanz (dmummenschanz@web.de) ---
 (In reply to Niklas.Cassel from comment #6)

Hello Niklas,

thanks for looking into this.

> It would be nice if you could test with latest v6.7-rcX.

Okay I took the latest 6.7-rc3 from Linux's git and included your patch. Bo=
oted
up my Laptop, put it back to sleep and brought it up again. See attached lo=
g.

I've disabed my link_power_management_policy override so all the time my sy=
stem
was stuck at pc2 package state according to powertop.

> For devsleep to get enabled, you need "sadm sds" in the SATA controller

Yep I can see that:
[    0.379531] ahci 0000:00:17.0: flags: 64bit ncq sntf stag pm clo only pio
slum part ems sxs deso sadm sds apst=20

> and "Dev-Sleep" in the SATA device print.

I guess this is it?
[    1.031169] ata5.00: Features: Trust Dev-Sleep NCQ-sndrcv

> Additionally, your lpm-policy (lpm-pol) has to be either ATA_LPM_MIN_POWE=
R or
> ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER_WITH_PARTIAL (i.e. lpm-pol has to print either 4 or 5).

I'm afraid this is not the case here:
[    0.399005] ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m2048@0x42233000 port 0x42233100
irq 125 lpm-pol 0

> Note that even if you have LPM_POLICY=3D3 (ATA_LPM_MED_POWER_WITH_DIPM) i=
n your

That would explain why I'm seeing "max_performance" in
link_power_management_policy without overriding it.


> The reason why many platforms do this override, is because:

Thanks for the insight.

I understand however I do not know of any other way to enable lower package
states on my machine.

Anything we can do to preserve the old bwhaviour until 6.6?

Yes, I had no issues up to 6.7-rc1.=20

Yweah, see logs.=20=20

I've attached the dmesg logs from kernel 6.6.


Thanks again for your help
