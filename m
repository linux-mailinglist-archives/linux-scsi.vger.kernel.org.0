Multipath does need to keep checking the marginal paths. For one thing,
just because a path is marginal, doesn't mean it belongs in the same
path group as every other marginal path. If you have an active/passive
array, then it's quite possible that you will have multiple marginal
path groups. A path's priority is updated when it is checked, and many
devices use this to determine the correct path groups. Also the checker
is what determines if a path is in a ghost (passive) state, which tells
multipath which path group to try next. For another thing, if all the
non-marginal paths fail, then the marginal path group will also be the
active path group, and we definitely want to be checking the paths on
the active path group.
