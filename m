IIRC, there was a bit in the IDENTIFY block that if set, meant that the
drive WOULD NOT automatically spin up on access, and you HAD to use SET
FEATURE to wake it.  I seem to recall that my Western Digital drives did
this and my bios would not recognize the drives as bootable because it
did not know how to issue SET FEATURE to force it to spin up.
