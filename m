Could we perhaps use scmd->allowed for this purpose?

I noted that several callers of scsi_execute_cmd() in your patch set
set the allowed parameter, e.g. to sdkp->max_retries in 07/34.
But allowed doesn't seem to be used at all in the passthrough case,
so we might as well use it as an upper limit for the total number of
retries.
