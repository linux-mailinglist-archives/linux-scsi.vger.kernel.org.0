Greetings Dear Friend

 This is the second times I am sending the same message to you, hoping
you will receive it in good faith, as I urgently need your assistance
in this humanitarian investment project to be establish in your
country, for the support and mutual benefit of the orphans, gives
justice and help to the poor, needy, elderly ones, disables and to
promote the words of God and the effort that the house of God will be
maintained says The Lord. Jeremiah 22:15-16, as I have been touched by
God to donate from what I have because it will be a great loss in
spending the fund on my health treatment hence my doctor has confirmed
to me that I will not survive this illness. My name is Mrs. Marina
Bagni, I am a widow diagnosed with brain tumor disease which has
gotten to a very bad stage which has gotten to a very bad stage and
presently I am partially suffering from a stroke illness which has
become almost impossible for me to move around. I am married to my
late husband for many years before he died last year 2019,
unfortunately we don't have any children of our own non any relation,
I grew up from the orphanage home before i got married, my doctor
confided to me that I have less chance to live as a result of my
illness. My late husband and I made a substantial deposit with the
Bank, Having known my present health condition I have decided to hand
over and entrust the sum of ($ 9,650,000.00) in our joint Account to
you to Invest into a charitable project in your country. Based on my
present health status I am permanently indisposed to handle finances
or any financial related project.

This is the reason I contacted you for your support and help to stand
as my rightful beneficiary and claim the money for humanitarian
purposes for the mutual benefits of the less privileged ones. Because
If the money remains unclaimed with the bank after my death, those
greedy bank executives will place the money as an unclaimed Fund and
share it for their selfish and worthless ventures. However I needs
your sincerity and ability to carry out this transaction and fulfill
my final wish in implementing the charitable investment project in
your country as it requires absolute trust and devotion without any
failure and It will be my pleasure to compensate you with part of the
money as my investment manager/partner for your effort in handling the
transaction, while the remaining amount of the money will be invested
into the charity project there in your country. I am waiting for your
prompt response if only you are interested I will give you further
details of the transaction. Your early response will be appreciated.

May God bless you.
Sincerely Mrs. Marina Bagni.
