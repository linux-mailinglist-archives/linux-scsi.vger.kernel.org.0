Hi Laurence,

Thank you for your reply!

I found it on Deepin 20, with a 4.19 kernel and a sata disk from a
Chinese manufacturer. 

After undergoing a disk stress test (fio), I found that the write
performance of the disk was poor for a period of time after rebooting. 

The disk manufacturer did some troubleshooting and tracing, and
told me that the disk did not receive the stop command during the
reboot process, so it will take some time to rebuild the internal data
structure after being powered on again. 

They showed me a list of commands they traced, and during the shutdown
process, they would receive a STANDBY IMMEDIATE command after FLUSH
CACHE EXT, but not during the restart process. 

Then I did some tests to confirm. I enabled dev.scsi.logging_level in
the debian12 virtual machine (with 6.6 kernel) and collected logs on
system reboot and shutdown. During the shutdown, the "Stopping disk"
log can be seen, but it is not present during the reboot. 

I also hope to do some comparative testing on other hard drives, but I
did not find the unsafe shutdown related field in the smart information
of the sata disk (maybe I just missed it), so I give up. 

I am not an expert in scsi, so I took a temporary look at the relevant
code and found sd_shutdown based on the "Stopping disk" log, and I also
browsed some related commits and discussions.

I feel that this may be a firmware implementation issue, but I'm not so
sure, so I come to the community to ask for some advice. 

Just now, I tested another machine (also Deepin system, but American
Megatrends firmware), the Seagate's sata disk does not increase
power_cycle_count during the reboot. I think maybe this is the
right behavior of the firmware. 

Welcome any suggestions and corrections, and thanks for all replies!
