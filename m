I'm not sure about this.  To be honest, I did not read the entirety of 
your last message; it had way too much detail.  THere's a time and place 
for that, but when you're brainstorming to figure out the underlying 
cause of a problem and come up with a strategy to fix it, you want to 
concentrate on the overall picture, not the details.

As I understand the situation, you've get a SCSI target with multiple 
logical units, let's say A and B, and you need to make sure that A never 
goes into runtime suspend unless B is already suspended.  In other 
words, B always has to suspend before A and resume after A.

To do this, you register a device link with A as the supplier and B as 
the consumer.  Then the PM core takes care of the ordering for you.

But I don't understand when you set up the device link.  If the timing 
is wrong then, thanks to async SCSI probing, you may have a situation 
where A is registered before B and before the link is set up.  Then 
there's temporarily nothing to stop A from suspending before B.

You also need to prevent each device from suspending before it is 
probed.  That's the easy part I was trying to address before (although 
it may not be so easy if the drivers are in loadable modules and not 
present in the kernel).

You need to think through these issues before proposing actual changes.

Like this; it's too early to worry about this sort of thing.
