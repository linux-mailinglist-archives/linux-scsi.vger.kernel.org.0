I started adding the comment and took another look at this, and that
made me change my mind. We really should make this a cmpxcgh, it's not
even using a device lock here.

I've dropped the two SCSI patches for now, Ming can you resend? If James
agrees, I really think queue_stopped should just have the type changed
and the patch redone with that using cmpxcgh().
