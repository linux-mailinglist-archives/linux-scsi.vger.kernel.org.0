Does this mean that the IRQ handler can complete an SSU command with an
error and that the error handler can later recover from that error? That
sounds completely wrong to me. The IRQ handler should never complete any
command with an error if that error could be recoverable. Instead, the
IRQ handler should add that command to a list and leave it to the error
handler to fail that command or to retry it.

Hmm ... it is not clear to me why this behavior is considered a problem?

What is wrong with blocking RPM while a START STOP UNIT command is being
processed? If there are UFS devices for which it takes long to process
that command I think it is up to the vendors of these devices to fix
these UFS devices.

Additionally, if a UFS device needs more than (retries * 60 seconds) to
process a START STOP UNIT command, shouldn't it be marked as broken?

Thanks,

Bart.
