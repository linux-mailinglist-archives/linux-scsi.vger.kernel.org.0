Yes.

Nothing new, it is just that for QLC drives with a 16k mapping table
a 4k write is internally a RMW.

Sure!

Yup..

Oh sure, but I'm suggesting that for drives without the large atomic
it should still help to have this as there is less aligned writes.

That is a sensible thing to me, I just wonder if there are some use
cases for users who want to opt-in for the pain to and want to accept
the 4k writes. It would be silly, but alas possible.

After thinking about this a bit, I don't think the pain of flexibility
is worth it. All userspace applications looking to do correct alignement
will use the logical block size, and if we keep that at 4k, and expect
them only to use the physical block sizes, it's just asking for pain.

I agree, I figured the above might need some discussion.

Yup.

Today's set_blocksize() call from xfs_setsize_buftarg() would limit
the block size set for the block device cache, ie, the sector size to
be lifted. Removing it would help allow us to extend the block device
cache to use sector sizes > 4k. That is, it is just one small step in that
direction. The other step is, as you have suggested before, to
enhance the block device cache so that we always use iomap aops and
and switch from iomap page state to buffer heads in the bdev mapping
interface via a synchronised invalidation + setting/clearing
IOMAP_F_BUFFER_HEAD in all new mapping requests [0]: that is to
implement support for bufferheads through the existing iomap
infrastructure.

A second consideration I had was if we wanted to have the flexibility to
have 16k atomic capable drive to allow 4k writes even though it also
prefers 16k, but that I think leads to madness. I am not sure if we
want to allow a 4k write on those drives just because its possible
through any new means.

It is not.

The only thing left worth discussing I think is if we want to let users to
opt-in to 4k sector size on a drive which allows 16k atomics and
prefers 16k for instance...

My current thinking is we just stick to 16k logical block sizes for
those drives. But I welcome further arguments against that.
