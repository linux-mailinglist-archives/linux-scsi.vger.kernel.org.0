hba->cmd_queue does not have runtime PM.

I suspect making it do runtime PM might open up deadlock issues similar to
the issues that were seen with sending sending clear WLUN UA from the
UFS error handler.

cmd_queue is used only by the UFS driver, so if the driver is racing with
itself at "remove", then that should be fixed. The risk is not that the UFS
driver might use requests, but that it might still be operating when hba or
other resources get freed.

So the question remains, for device commands, we do not need the block
layer, nor SCSI commands which still begs the question, why involve them
at all?
