Ask that to T13 :) Need a media access command to get out of sleep state...
Could use a read, but then need a buffer, which is silly for just waking up a
drive. VERIFY is a mandatory command.

START STOP UNIT with start == 1 has been translated to a VERIFY command since
forever. This is according to SAT specs. There is no command to explicitly get
out of standby-mode. Even a reset should not change the drive power state
(though I do see a lot of drive waking up on COMRESET). A media access command
does that. See ACS specs "Power Management states and transitions". The only
exception is that you can use SET FEATURE command to wake up a drive, but only
from PUIS state (Power-Up in Standby), which is a different feature that is not
necessarilly supported by a device.
