"short term" in the embedded world means "this device is stuck with this
chip for the next 8 years", it's not like a storage device you can
replace, so this might be different than the shingle drive mess.  Also,
I see many old SoCs still showing up in brand new devices many many
years after they were first introduced, on-chip storage controllers is
something we need to support well if we don't want to see huge
out-of-tree patchsets like UFS traditionally has been lugging around for
many years.

Ok, showing that this actually matters is a good rule, Daejun, can you
provide that if you resubmit this patchset?
