I don't have a sysfs node for runtime_active_kids in my system.
My controller runtime_status has changed to "suspended" after step b.

[root@localhost ~]# cat /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/power/runtime_status
suspended

The results in my system are as follows:

[root@localhost ~]# cat /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/reset_method
acpi flr pm

Before step a, the hisi_sas driver reference count is 0.
After step b, the driver reference count is 0.
At step d, the reference count is 2405 (this value is not the same every time).

hisi_sas_v3_hw         77824  2405
hisi_sas_main          45056  1 hisi_sas_v3_hw
libsas                 98304  2 hisi_sas_v3_hw,hisi_sas_main
