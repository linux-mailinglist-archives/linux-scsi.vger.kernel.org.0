I see.

FWIW, not using scsi_get_host_dev() means that internal command 
scsi_cmnd.device cannot be set. But then many fields are not set there.

I suppose that if we delete scsi_get_host_dev() now [as it has no user], 
then that will narrow the choice...

BTW, I was just checking the v7, and we have no queue sysfs folder for 
that host scsi_device. Regardless of how the queue is created - v2 vs v7 
method - I think that we should have that somehow.

Thanks,
John
