None unfortunately

jfyi, Ajish, cc'ed, from microchip says that they see the same issue on 
their arm64 system. Unfortunately fixing it is not a priority for them. 
So it is something which arm64 is exposing.

And I tried an old kernel - like 4.10 - on the same board and the pm8001 
driver was working somewhat reliably (no hangs). It just looks like a 
driver issue.

I'll have a look at the driver code again if I get a chance. It might be 
a DMA issue.

I think that the drives are ok. On the same board I originally had them 
plugged in the hisi_sas HBA and no issues.

thanks,
john
