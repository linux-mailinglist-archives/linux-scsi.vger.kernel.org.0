The new code spends little time scanning the active request
list so I see very little benefit from the O(1) random access
capability that I assume xarray would offer. It might be useful
if my code could access the active request list/array by pack_id.
That would require sparse array support, but even that is not
sufficient because the pack_id is user supplied and there has never
been a requirement in the sg driver that the pack_id be unique.
If they search responses by pack_id and its not unique then the
first found on the list is given back. That will typically be the
oldest.


BTW I have added a per file descriptor soft limit on the sum
of data-in and data-out buffers in use (sg_fd::sum_fd_dlens).
That is meant to trip up a malformed user space app (e.g. with
ioctl(SG_IOSUBMIT) in an infinite loop) from eating up all the
kernel's memory.

They are all in one place ***:

static int
sg_ctl_scsi_id(struct scsi_device *sdev, struct sg_fd *sfp, void __user *p)
{
         struct sg_scsi_id __user *sg_idp = p;
         struct scsi_lun lun8b;

         SG_LOG(3, sfp, "%s:    SG_GET_SCSI_ID\n", __func__);
         if (unlikely(!access_ok(p, sizeof(struct sg_scsi_id))))
                 return -EFAULT;

         if (unlikely(SG_IS_DETACHING(sfp->parentdp)))
                 return -ENODEV;
         __put_user((int)sdev->host->host_no,
                    &sg_idp->host_no);
         __put_user((int)sdev->channel, &sg_idp->channel);
         __put_user((int)sdev->id, &sg_idp->scsi_id);
         __put_user((int)sdev->lun, &sg_idp->lun);
         __put_user((int)sdev->type, &sg_idp->scsi_type);
         __put_user((short)sdev->host->cmd_per_lun,
                    &sg_idp->h_cmd_per_lun);
         __put_user((short)sdev->queue_depth,
                    &sg_idp->d_queue_depth);
         int_to_scsilun(sdev->lun, &lun8b);
         __copy_to_user(sg_idp->scsi_lun, lun8b.scsi_lun, 8);
         return 0;
}

So its an optimization with a (pretty small) risk that the user
space process disappears after the access_ok() and before the
final __copy_to_user() completes.

Obviously a better way is to build the output in a kernel based object
and copy_to_user() the lot in one shot.

*** which you would now if you had been applying the patches to the
     in kernel driver as you went. Reviewing a big patch set (in this
     case: on about 3000 lines, changing half of them and ending up with
     4500 lines) without reference to the effect they have on the
     existing code (by applying them) is 'impressive'. Like doing
     analysis on a chess match when you can't see the board but instead
     have a long list of moves from a starting position that you only
     have a fuzzy recollection of.
