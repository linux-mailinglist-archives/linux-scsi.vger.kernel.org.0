Dear friend,

Have you received your fund? You have suffered for nothing without
receiving your fund due to over greediness. You would have received
your fund since last year, but your problem is over greediness, which
have cost you a lot of money and yet, you have never received $1 into
your account.

Your total partial payment of (US$5,700 000.00 Million) has been
lodged with the Bank, this is a secret information and I=E2=80=99m expectin=
g
your urgent response before I can give you more details with the
contact information of the bank, where your fund was deposited. You
may see this message as joke, because of what you passed through from
the bad officials previously.

Listen very carefully,  if you have received your part payment from
your fund, let me know but if you did not receive it till today. reply
this message urgently to my private email:
mrsergesaahissou@indamail.hu

NOTE: I created a different email to contact you because this piece of
information I revealed to you is a secret about your UNPAID FUND.
Wherefore, you should keep it a secret.

I await your urgent reply.

Thanks!

Mr.Serges Ahissou
Senior Supervisor
IMF Regonal office, Cotonou Benin
