Sheesh.

There _is_ an easy solution for this, and that is to not use PQ=1 in 
conjunction with ALUA unavailable :-)

Hiding PQ=1 devices did serve the purpose for linux as we still cannot 
to a 'real' rescan of a SCSI device; the 'vendor' and 'model' string is 
pretty much fixed for the lifetime of the device, alongside with the 
entire standard inquiry data. So if anything changes here we have to 
delete the device before we can properly read it.

(which also means that I'll have to retract my earlier comment about 
this being a good idea ...)

And in the absence of that hiding PQ=1 devices is the best we can do.
The alternative would be to implement a 'real' device rescan; but that 
was too daunting a challenge to be undertaken until now.
Things did change in the meantime, so maybe it's time to revisit that.

But really, we should ask vendors to _not_ use PQ=1 when using ALUA. I 
fail to see the benefit of this as both have roughly the same meaning; 
if you have ALUA unavailable you can't access the device, hence it's 
completely irrelevant what PQ says. And same for the other way round: if 
PQ=1 is set really the only ALUA state which makes sense is 'unavailable'.

Sadly it's not so easy to fix things up in the SCSI stack, as the PQ 
setting is evaluated during scanning, and the ALUA state way back later.

Cheers,

Hannes
