SCSI standards did contain words that implied vendors would report all
VPD/log/mode pages and operation codes using the mechanisms added to
those standards over the years. I guess users pressured vendors to do
this. Then recently, in T10 approved proposal 21-063r2, the weasel
words "may or may not" were added to all those mechanisms. IMO that
was a pretty disgraceful move by the storage vendors that control T10.

P.S. I have a new option appearing in some of my utilities: --examine
The idea is that it uses an iota function to check for unreported
VPD/log/mode pages as the "report supported" device server responses
"may or may not" be trustworthy :-)
