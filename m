There are two scenarios here. In the scenario of someone increasing can_queue
after the tag set is allocated, I agree, blk-mq will never take advantage
of this. However, in the scenario of someone *decreasing* can_queue after the
tag set is allocated, prior to 6eb045e092ef, the shost->host_busy code provided
this protection.

For ibmvfc, the total number of commands that the scsi host supports is very
much a dynamic value. It can increase and it can decrease. Live migrating
a logical partition from one system to another is the usual cause of
such a capability change. For ibmvfc, at least, this only ever happens
when we've self blocked the host and have sent back all outstanding I/O.

However, looking at other drivers that modify can_queue dynamically, this
doesn't always hold true. Looking at libfc, it looks to dynamically ramp
up and ramp down can_queue based on its ability to handle requests.

There are certainly a number of other drivers that change can_queue
after the tag set has been allocated. Some of these drivers could
likely be changed to avoid doing this, but changing them all will likely
be difficult.

Thanks,

Brian
