Hello and Greetings Dear Friend,

I know it will be a great surprise to you reading this message from me
today. Haven't known each other or met before. But I want you to
consider this as God divine intervention and opportunity which I
believe that You and I can cooperate together in this humanitarian
social project only for the glory and honor of God. My names are Mrs.
Dee Parsons,  I am a dying widow hospitalized undergoing treatment for
brain tumor disease. Because of this reason i decided to seek for your
sincerity and ability to carry out this transaction and fulfill my
final wish in implementing the charitable social project in your
country as it requires absolute trust and devotion without any
failure, which i believe that you are a reliable person and you will
not expose or betray this trust and confident that I'm about to
entrust on you. My late husband made a substantial deposit with the
bank with my name as the beneficiary which I decided to hand over and
entrust the sum of ($ 12,500,000.00, Dollars) in the account to you to
invest into the humanitarian social project. Based on my present
health status as I'm permanently indisposed to handle finances or any
financial related project, following my diagnoses. Having known my
present health condition, I decided to seek for your assistance in
reclaiming the fund for the support and mutual benefit of the less
privileged as I don't have any relation, and I have been touched by
God to donate from what I have to the needy because it will be a great
loss in spending the fund on my health treatment hence my doctor has
confirmed to me that i will not survive this illness.

This is the reason I contacted you for your support and help to stand
as my rightful beneficiary and claim the money for humanitarian
purposes for the mutual benefits of the less privileged ones. Because
If the money remains unclaimed with the bank after my death, those
greedy bank executives will place the money as an unclaimed Fund and
share it for their selfish and worthless ventures. It will be my
pleasure to compensate you with part of the money as my Investment
Manager/Partner for your effort in handling the transaction, while the
remaining amount of the money will be invested into the charity
project there in your country.

Can you handle the transaction? and use the fund for the support and
mutual benefit of the less privileged ones.

Regards.
Mrs. Parsons Dee.
