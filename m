"normal" I/O should not really happen by the time it is deleted.  That
being said we should do this only after the fsync is done. While no
one should rely on that I'm pretty sure some file systems do.
So we'll actually need a deleted flag.

I'm not really woried about the check itself.  That being
sais this inode cache line is not hot right now, so moving it to
disk->state will help as we need to check the read-only flag in
the the I/O submission path anyway.

Yes.  I actually misread the old code - it atually does two
blk_freeze_queue_start, but it also includes the wait.

Is it?  For the typical case the second free in blk_cleanp_queue will
be bsically free because there is no pending I/O.  The only case
where that matters if if there is pending passthrough I/O again,
which can only happen with SCSI, and even there is highly unusual.
