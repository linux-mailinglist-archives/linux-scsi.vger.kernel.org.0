One thing to note is that a long time ago I had to fix libsas for broken 
DMA API usage which was exposed when the IOMMU enabled, which also seems 
strange not to be noticed then.

See commit 9702c67c6066 ("scsi: libsas: fix ata xfer length")

I doubt it, especially since !IOMMU seems ok.

Hopefully.
