It should be true, because there is other run queue somewhere, such as
blk-mq's restart or delay run queue.

OK.

OK.

Right.

I think the above change is right, and this patter is basically same with SCHED_RESTART
used in blk_mq_sched_restart().

BTW, could you run your function & performance test against the following new version?
Then I can include your test result in commit log for moving on.

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: core: only re-run queue in scsi_end_request() if device
 queue is busy

Now the request queue is run in scsi_end_request() unconditionally if both
target queue and host queue is ready. We should have re-run request queue
only after this device queue becomes busy for restarting this LUN only.

Recently Long Li reported that cost of run queue may be very heavy in
case of high queue depth. So improve this situation by only running
the request queue when this LUN is busy.

V4:
	- not clear .restarts in get_budget(), instead clearing it
	after re-run queue is done; Kashyap figured out we have to
	update ->restarts before re-run queue in scsi_run_queue_async().

V3:
	- add one smp_mb() in scsi_mq_get_budget() and comment

V2:
	- commit log change, no any code change
	- add reported-by tag
