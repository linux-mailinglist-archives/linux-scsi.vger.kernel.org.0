yep.

Then suspend again 10s later.

But that verify sent 10s earlier to spinup the drive failed... Hmmm... That is
not exactly what I was thinking of. While the race between scheduling suspend
while resume is still on-going does exist, it is likely not what is happening
here given the time interval with suspend entry. Need to dig further.
Do you perhaps have "Power-up in Standby" (PUIS) enabled on that drive ?
