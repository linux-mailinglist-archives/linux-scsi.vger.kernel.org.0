Subject: [PATCH v19 00/45] sg: add v4 interface
Date:   Sun, 23 May 2021 21:01:02 -0400
Message-Id: <20210524010147.94845-1-dgilbert@interlog.com>

This patchset is the first stage of a two stage rewrite of the scsi
generic (sg) driver. The main goal of the first stage is to introduce
the sg v4 interface that uses 'struct sg_io_v4' as well as keeping and
modernizing the sg v3 interface (based on 'struct sg_io_hdr'). The
async interface formerly requiring the use of write() and read()
system calls now have ioctl(SG_IOSUBMIT) and ioctl(SG_IORECEIVE)
replacements.

For documentation see either url:
    https://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg_v40.html
    https://doug-gilbert.github.io/sg_v40.html

This patchset is against Martin Petersen's 5.14/scsi-queue branch.


Changes since v18 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210407)
  - a request queue's QUEUE_FLAG_POLL flag can be cleared via
    sysfs, overriding the ability to use blk_poll() even when the
    associated LLD allows it. Check that flag and, only when it
    is set and the sg user gives SGV4_FLAG_HIPRI, set REQ_HIPRI
    on a request.
  - simplify the functions supporting ioctl(SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE)
  - replace blk_rq_append_bio() calls with the simpler
    blk_rq_bio_prep() calls
    [see lk: a4fe2d3afe3ce77edeadb567c0d0a8d102c6b159]
  - rebase on 5.14/scsi-queue branch [lk 5.13-0-rc1]
    - unchecked_isa_dma removed
    - BIO_MAX_PAGES renamed to BIO_MAX_VECS

Changes since v17 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210407)
  - make clearer distinction between user pollable (i.e. async)
    requests and (user) non-pollable requests (e.g. those injected
    with ioctl(SG_IO), IOWs sync requests)
  - fix crash is sg_start_req() when blk_get_request() yields an
    error (e.g. -EAGAIN when low on resources)
  - sg_finish_scsi_blk_rq(): remove now_zero variable as suggested
    by Hannes R.
  - change deprecation warning url reference from http to https

Changes since v16 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210208)
  - sg_start_req() fix double free on error path [KASAN]
  - sg_rq_map_kern() fix uninitialized variable [coverity]
  - sg_add_sfp() fix use after free [coverity]
  - sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(): remove pointless NULL check [coverity]
  - fix misuse of WARN_ONCE in sg_rq_end_io_usercontext() [D. Carpenter]
  - remove unused error checks: tracking blk_put_request() calls and
    multiple SG_XA_RQ_FREE calls
  - hipri: as blk_poll() can return > 0 for requests other than the one
    that is being checked for, need to re-check that request is ready
  - rebased on MKP's 5.13/scsi-queue

Changes since v15 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210125)
  - tweak state machine which sets INFLIGHT state _before_
    blk_execute_rq_nowait() is called. Add a bit flag that indicates
    the logic flow has returned from that call. This guards against
    blk_poll() being called before the block layer has really
    launched the request.
  - fix bug clearing SG_FFD_HIPRI_SEEN bit as
    atomic_dec_and_test() returns true when the post-decrement value
    is zero, the opposite of what a C conditional does.

Changes since v14 and earlier
