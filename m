A kernel panic has been reported caused by I/O arriving after driver's
shutdown (the driver is fixed now so just scsi exception handling is
logged).
All drivers should have a protection against late commands queued, with
a block after sd.shutdown that could be dropped  and so well written
drivers could enjoy a bit easier/faster code and and those not well
written wouldn't be waiting for issues yet to come.

What actually is the downside of blocking further I/O in sd shutdown?
