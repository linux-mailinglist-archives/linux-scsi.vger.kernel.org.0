My Beloved!

Peace be Upon You

I am glad to know you, but God knows you better and he knows why he
has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be afraid.

I am Mrs. Nicole Marois Benoite, and i have been suffering from
ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that i have just few days
to leave. I am from (Paris) France but based in Africa Burkina Faso
since eleven years ago as a business woman dealing with gold
exportation.

Now that i am about to end the race like this, without any family
members and no child. I have $3 Million US DOLLARS in Africa
Development Bank (A.D.B) Burkina Faso which i instructed the bank to
give St Andrews Missionary Home in Burkina Faso. But my mind is not at
rest because i am writing this letter now through the help of my
computer beside me sick bed.

I also have $8.5 Million US Dollars at Bank of Africa (B.O.A), and i
instructed the bank to transfer the fund to you as foreigner that will
apply to the bank after i have gone, that they should release the fund
to him/her, but you will assure me that you will take 50% of the fund
and give 50% to the orphanages home in your country for my heart to
rest.

Respond to me immediately through this my private email address
(mrsnicolemaroisbenoite92@aol.com) for further details since I have
just few days to end my life due to the ovarian cancer disease, hoping
you will understand my point.

Please respond.

Yours Dying Sister

Mrs Nicole Marois
