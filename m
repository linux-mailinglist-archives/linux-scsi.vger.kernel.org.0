Yes, for OP-TEE we have to encrypt all data going to RPMB, since the
information goes via non-secure world. We get the integrity by applying
the HMAC with the key that is being discussed in this thread. The TEE
owns and is responsible for programming the key (and that should be
something that is achieved as part of the manufacturing process).

The concern I have in those cases is that you need to share the RPMB key
in some way if you need to access the RPMB device from secure side as
well as from the non-secure side. Technically doable I guess, but in
practice and in terms of security it doesn't seem like a good approach.

In a shared environment like that you also have the problem that you
need to agree on how to actually store files on the RPMB device. OP-TEE
has it's own "FAT-look-a-like" implementation when using RPMB. But if
you need mutual access, then you need to get into agreement on where to
actually store the files in the RPMB.

However, if secure side for some reason doesn't use RPMB at all, then
kernel could of course take control of it and use it.

I would probably not spend too much time on taking that use case into
account until we actually see a real need for it.
