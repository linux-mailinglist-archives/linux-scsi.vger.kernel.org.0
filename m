--- Comment #27 from Maxim (leyyyyy@gmail.com) ---
I have the same issue with openSUSE and Fedora new kernels.
When I installed Leap 15.5 with 5.14 kernel or COPR for Fedora with kernel =
5.15
all works fine.

First time I got the issue with kernel 5.19 on Fedora and ASR-72405 control=
ler
with connected NetApp DS.

openUSE 6.6.1 dmesg log:
```
