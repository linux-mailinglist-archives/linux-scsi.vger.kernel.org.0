This feature is completley broken, and rather dangerous due to feeding
"physical" addresses looked up by the host in.  I do not think we should
support something that broken in Linux.

Independent of that using two requests in the I/O path is not going
to fly either.  The whole thing seems like an exercise in benchmarketing.
