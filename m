Digging into my T10 document archive I found this cam3r03.pdf :

   − cam_resid;
     The data residual length member contains the difference in twos
     complement form of the number of data bytes transferred by the
     HA for the SCSI command compared with the number of bytes
     requested by the CCB cam_dxfer_len member. This is calculated
     by the total number of bytes requested to be transferred by the
     CCB minus the actual number of bytes transferred by the HA.

CAM is a now withdrawn T10 standard from the 1990s that was influential
at the time. FreeBSD's SCSI subsystem is (still) based on CAM.

For a more recent standard/draft there is fcp5r00.pdf that uses the
term "residual value" when defining its fcp_resid.

The only reference to the term "residue" that I found is in CAM: an
optional message: IGNORE WIDE RESIDUE .

So I would leave the naming up to the patch author. It is pretty
clear what is being referred to in either case.

P.S. I prefer "residual" because it is more flexible being both
an adjective and a noun.
