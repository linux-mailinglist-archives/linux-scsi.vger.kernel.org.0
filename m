That is with my pm8001 card.

What happens here is that the first store of 33 gets through to 
ata_change_queue_depth() as it does not exceed the SAS shost can_queue, 
which is >> 32, and then we cap this to 32 and store it in 
sdev->queue_depth. And then the 2nd store of 33 also gets through, but 
this following expression not evaluate true in ata_change_queue_depth():

queue_depth < 1 || queue_depth == sdev->queue_depth

So we don't return. However the following subsequent test does evaluate 
true in ata_change_queue_depth():

if (sdev->queue_depth == queue_depth)
	return -EINVAL;

And we error.

Hmmmm... why no error message? is the printk silenced?
