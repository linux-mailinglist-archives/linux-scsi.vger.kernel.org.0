Regarding m68k, your analysis overlooks the timing issue. E.g. patch 11/32 
could be a problem because removing the irqsave would allow PDMA transfers 
to be interrupted. Aside from the timing issues, I agree with your 
analysis above regarding m68k.

With regard to other architectures and platforms, in specific cases, e.g. 
where there's never more than one IRQ involved, then I could agree that 
your assumptions probably hold and an irqsave would be probably redundant.

When you find a redundant irqsave, to actually patch it would bring a risk 
of regression with little or no reward. It's not my place to veto this 
entire patch series on that basis but IMO this kind of churn is misguided.
