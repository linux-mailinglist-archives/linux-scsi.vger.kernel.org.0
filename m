Right, so in this case we can use this patch to address this issue 
probably. If evt/ctl vq is not used, we won't even create them.

It allows libvirt to open and pass fds to qemu. This is how multie-queue 
virtio-net is done, libvirt is in charge of opening multiple file 
descriptors and pass them to qemu.

Usually qemu is running without privilege. So it depends on the 
management to open the device.

Note that I'm not object your proposal, just want to see if it could be 
done via a more easy way. During the development if multiqueue 
virito-net, something similar as you've done was proposed but we end up 
with the multiple vhost-net fd model which keeps kernel code unchanged.

Thanks
