In general it is better not to put in changes that affect older drivers
that are not regularly tested, I think.  I would prefer an opt-in for
drivers desiring higher performance.

Delaying the queue re-run vs. a ramp down might negatively affect performan=
ce.
I'm not sure how accurate the ramp is at discovering the optimum though.
