I will help with some tests if needed.

I agree with the view that the device should comeback up to normal operation.
But at the moment, that's not the case.

OK, first of all, I have the following controllers and disks in my system:
[root@localhost ~]# lsscsi -v

[N:0:1:1]    dsk/nvm HWE56P433T2M002N__1                        /dev/nvme0n1	------> this is my system disk
  dir: /sys/class/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1  [/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0c.0/0000:03:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1]

All disks are connected to the HiSilicon's SAS controller (0000:b4:02.0),
and my system disk is connected to another controller (0000:03:00.0).

In step a, I suspend all disks by issuing the following command to all disks
attached to the SAS controller 0000:b4:02.0:
[root@localhost ~]# echo auto > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:0/end_device-6:0/target6:0:0/6:0:0:0/power/control
[root@localhost ~]# echo 5000 > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:0/end_device-6:0/target6:0:0/6:0:0:0/power/autosuspend_delay_ms
...
[root@localhost ~]# echo auto > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:6/end_device-6:6/target6:0:6/6:0:6:0/power/control
[root@localhost ~]# echo 5000 > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:6/end_device-6:6/target6:0:6/6:0:6:0/power/autosuspend_delay_ms

Step b, Suspend the SAS controller:
[root@localhost ~]# echo auto > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/power/control

At this point, the SAS controller is suspended. Next step c is trigger PCI FLR.
[root@localhost ~]# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:b4:02.0/reset

These are the exact commands triggered by issue 1.

The following is the exact commands triggered by issue 2, and it's also on this
same machine.

Step a is to suspend all disks attached to the SAS controller:
[root@localhost ~]# echo auto > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:0/end_device-6:0/target6:0:0/6:0:0:0/power/control
[root@localhost ~]# echo 5000 > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:0/end_device-6:0/target6:0:0/6:0:0:0/power/autosuspend_delay_ms
...
[root@localhost ~]# echo auto > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:6/end_device-6:6/target6:0:6/6:0:6:0/power/control
[root@localhost ~]# echo 5000 > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:6/end_device-6:6/target6:0:6/6:0:6:0/power/autosuspend_delay_ms

Step b is to suspend the SAS controller:
[root@localhost ~]# echo auto > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/power/control

Step c is to resuming all suspend disks:
[root@localhost ~]# echo on > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:0/end_device-6:0/target6:0:0/6:0:0:0/power/control
...
[root@localhost ~]# echo on > /sys/devices/pci0000:b4/0000:b4:02.0/host6/port-6:6/end_device-6:6/target6:0:6/6:0:6:0/power/control

Step d is to check the driver reference counting:
[root@localhost ~]# lsmod | grep hisi_sas_v3_hw
hisi_sas_v3_hw         77824  1436
