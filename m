I think that a couple of things are needed to get to where my =
expectation of how it should work would be. First this code should come =
out of the not ready sense check. The reason is that it will continually =
override alua_check=E2=80=99s attempt to change the pg state as it =
exceeds the allowed time and the path state is changed to standby to =
handle a misbehaving target which stays in transitioning past the timer.

Second for this to work how it used to work in Linux and how it works =
for other OS=E2=80=99s where ALUA state transition is not a fail path =

Because, as you said the expiation check for whether to continually =
allow new I/O on the pg is in the prep function of the ALUA handler. I =
think that this does introduce a lot error processing for a target that =
will respond quickly. Maybe there is some way to use the equivalent of =
ACTION_DELAYED_RETRY so that the target is not as aggressively retried =
in the transitioning state.

It is possible, maybe likely, in other OS=E2=80=99s that this retry is =
done at the multipath level. The DSM from Microsoft in GitHub would seem =
to show that Windows does it that way. The multipath-tools in Linux =
though don=E2=80=99t seem to use sense data to make decisions so getting =
this logic in would seem like a decent set of changes and getting the =
buy-in to go that route.

Thanks,
Brian
