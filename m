 Sometimes you have little choice really and that would be less disruptive 
than dropping support altogether.  Even if there's a small issue somewhere 
it's easier to fix by a competent developer who actually gets the hands on 
a piece of hardware than bringing back old code that has been removed and 
consequently not updated according to internal API evolution, etc.

 I had this issue with the defxx driver with which for years I didn't have 
a specimen of the EISA variant of the hardware handled.  I did my best to 
maintain EISA support however and while indeed I made a few of mistakes on 
the way, they were easy to straighten out once I finally did get my hands 
on an EISA piece.

 I guess you won't see the issue with a FlashPoint adapter as they work in 
a different manner.  I think your EISA MultiMaster device is more likely 
to have a problem here.

 And AFAICT most SCSI commands (or at least the older ones which used to 
be there when development was still active with the MultiMaster devices) 
return exactly as much data as requested, so I guess the issue may have 
gone unnoticed.  I'll see if I can find some time to investigate this 
further now that we have proper documentation available, but meanwhile I 
do hope the workaround I have come up with 18 years ago already is good 
enough to keep it.
