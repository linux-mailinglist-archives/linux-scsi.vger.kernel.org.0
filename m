Thank you for explanation. But I think you a not right here.
Preempt And Abort is used to change the reservation holder and abort
preempted session's commands. A preempted session is not allowed to send
any new messages, they will be failed anyway.
So we are safe here. Or did I miss something?

Considering that (if) I am right with PreemptAndAbort,
to address multiple LUN_RESET issue it's enough to wrap
core_tmr_lun_reset and skip all LUN_RESETs in target_drain_tmr_list.
Without any new lists. That would be as simple patch as possible.
