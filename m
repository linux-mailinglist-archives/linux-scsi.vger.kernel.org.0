Sure, but this is the Scsi host interface, not the blk-mq interface.

So I think that the Scsi host interface is somewhat deficient as things 
stand (for same reason I gave). It can be revisited.

OK, fine. So please check my latest reply on that thread when you have a 
chance - I may have found an issue.

ok
