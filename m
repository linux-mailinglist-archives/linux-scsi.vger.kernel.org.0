It is not the scsi driver looking for partitions. This is generic block
layer code rescanning the partition table together with disk revalidate
after the bdev is closed. The disk revalidate should have caught the
change in LBA size, so it may be that the partition scan is before
revalidate instead of after... That would need checking.

It was observed in the past that some HBAs (Broadcom I think it was)
returned a resid not aligned to the LBA size with 4Kn disks, making it
impossible to restart the command to process the reminder of the data.
This problem was especially apparent with ZBC disks writes.

So unaligned here is not just for ZBC disks.
