Kai,

Thank you for these patches. This is a huge improvement to scsi_debug tape emulator and I am sure everyone will use this.

I must admit that I cheated a little bit with some of the test results I posted here as I did not test each patch,
but rather tested this whole series. I'll also admit I didn't really test the compression stuff.  I'll need
to develop some more tests to do that.

At this point the scsi_debug tape emulator is working as well as a real tape drive.  This will enable
me to greatly simplify and streamline my tape_tests.  I should now be able to consolidate everything
down into one or two test scripts that can be run against either a hardware tape device or the scsi_debug
tape device. There is certainly more room for improvements in my tests and these patches will enable that work.

The latest version of my tests are in the branch.

https://github.com/johnmeneghini/tape_tests/tree/version_5a

I'll work on improving theses tests as soon as this patches get merged upstream.

Martin, please merge these patches.
