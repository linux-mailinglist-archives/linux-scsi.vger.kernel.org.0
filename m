That's on Qualcomm.  But my understanding is that it's just taking them several
years to get the TZ changes out due to their branching schedule.  Garauv
submitted the TZ changes in 2021, but apparently SM8550 had already branched at
that point, so SM8650 is the first one that will have it.

Just because it takes Qualcomm a while to get the firmware support for this
feature deployed doesn't mean that it's the wrong approach.

The same way they did before.  Older devices won't use this new code.

BTW, this is irrelevant for upstream.

I have very little insight into Qualcomm's old interface, which is tied to the
Android-specific KeyMint and is not known to be usable outside the Android
context or without the closed source userspace HAL from Qualcomm.

I understand that Linux kernel features that are only usable with closed source
userspace libraries are heavily frowned on.  As are features that are tied to
Android and cannot be used on other Linux distros.

If Qualcomm can document the old interface and show that it's usable directly by
the Linux kernel, then we could consider it.  But without that, the new
interface is our only option.

This is a strange line of questioning for upstream review, as this feature does
not exist upstream.  This is the first time it will be supported by upstream
Linux, ever.  Adding support for this feature does not break anything.

Downstream users who implemented a less well designed version of this feature
can continue to use their existing code.

BTW, I am the person who has gotten stuck maintaining the framework for
HW-wrapped key support in the Android Common Kernels...  So if you're trying to
make things "easier" for me, please don't.  I want to have a properly designed
version of the feature upstream, and then I'll change Android to use that
whenever possible.  That's the only real long-term solution.
