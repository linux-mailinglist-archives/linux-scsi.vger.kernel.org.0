Sort of. I was saying to just drop the SCMD_NORETRIES_ABORT related code
and when you detect the port state here fail the IO.

I=E2=80=99m a little confused. In the 0/17 email you wrote:

-----

This feature is intended to be used when the device is part of a =
multipath
environment. When the service detects the poor connectivity, the =
multipath
path can be placed in a marginal path group and ignored further io
operations.

After placing a path in the marginal path group,the daemon sets the
port_state to Marginal which sets bit in scmd->state for all the

=E2=80=94=E2=80=94

So it sounded like this is would only be used for mpio enabled paths.

Is this the daemon you mention in the 0/17 email:

https://github.com/brocade/bsn-fc-txptd

?

I might be completely misunderstanding you though. If the above link
is for your daemon then going off the 0/17 email and the GitHub README =
it
sounds like you are doing:

1. bsn-fc-txptd gets ELS, and moves affected paths to new marginal path =
group.
2. The non-marginal paths stay in the active path group and are =
continued to
be used like normal.
3. The paths in the marginal path group are not used until we get link =
up
or another ELS that indicates the paths are ok.

For these outstanding IOs on marginal paths, it sounds like you are =
flushing
the existing IO on them.mOnce they complete they will be in the marginal =
group
and not be used until #3.

So it=E2=80=99s not clear to me if you know the path is not optimal and =
might hit
a timeout, and you are not going to use it once the existing IO =
completes why
even try to send it? I mean in this setup, new commands that are =
entering
the dm-multipath layer will not be sent to these marginal paths right?

Also for the TUR comment, what TUR do you mean exactly? =46rom the SCSI =
EH?
