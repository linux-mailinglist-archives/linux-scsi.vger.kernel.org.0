OK, at least I got something right.  ;-)

Ah, I _think_ I see what you mean.  So there should be no race because
the "has_work" is just a hint?  It's assumed that whichever task gets
the budget will be able to dispatch all the work that's there.  Is
that right?

I guess what I'm saying is that if there is a choice between the two
we have to choose correctness.  If there is a bug and we don't know of
any way to fix it other than with a fix that regresses performance
then we have to regress performance.  I wasn't able to find a way to
fix the bug (as I understood it) without regressing performance, but
I'd be happy if someone else could come up with a way.

OK, so I guess this puts it in Paolo's court then.  I'm about done for
the evening, but maybe he can comment on it or come up with a fix?
