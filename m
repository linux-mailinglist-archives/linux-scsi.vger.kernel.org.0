I want to check FS case though. No clear if mounting FS that supports zone
(btrfs) also uses bdev open ?

New BIOs (BIOS that have never been plugged yet) will go through the normal
blk_queue_enter() in blk_mq_submit_bio(), so they will be stopped there if
another context asked for a queue freeze. I do not think there is any issue with
how things are currently done (we tested that *a lot* with many different drives
and drive configs with DM etc). Reference counting as it is is OK, even though
it most likely be simplified. I am looking at that now.
