Stepping back from the details, this is all new stuff (i.e. iopoll/
blk_poll in the scsi subsystem). The patches it depends on by Kashyap
Desai haven't hit the mainline yet. My testing is based on a patch
in the scsi_debug driver modelling the way I think it will work. My
megaraid hardware is from the previous century (or close to it) so
I doubt that I can test it on real hardware in the short term.

Plus I believe iopoll/blk_poll will work async (or at least I haven't
found a reason why not) but all the blk_poll() code I have found
in the kernel is only sync.

Somewhat related to this discussion I have found a new issue that
I would like to fix. So I plan to have a version 18 . Plus I have
been changing http to https in the various links to my documentation.
