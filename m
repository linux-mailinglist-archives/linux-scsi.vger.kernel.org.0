Oh ... I wasn't expecting the Spanish Inquisition.

Sorry, I did do a test merge with the current state of your tree when I
sent the pull request, but, obviously, that didn't include the Arnd
changes and I've taken to rely on linux-next as the merge problem
canary for trees you haven't yet pulled.

We're definitely not having a read/write case for the proposed v4
protocol ... however we are a bit stuck with it for the existing v3
case.
