And it is non-bisectable (I guess) and could only be made bisectable
(without some ugly unions) by rolling it up into one patch. But having
separate patches definitely makes it easier for me to look at the
sg and scsi_debug driver changes, which look fine at first glance.

Is there any way to mark a patchset like this non-bisectable? And
I think a separate patch that explains why this is being done (cause
the cover-sheet gets lost). Then git might think of a way not to
repeat that explanation 107 times.
