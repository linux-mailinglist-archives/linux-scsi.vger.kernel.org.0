What is the midlevel queue? I don't know anyone who still uses that
terminology today. Since the switch to scsi-mq we have software queues
(if no I/O scheduler has been configured), scheduler queue(s) (if an I/O
scheduler has been configured) and hardware queues.

That looks inconsistent: the function description refers to block device
I/O requests while what is being completed is a SCSI command.

I am not aware of any function in the kernel tree that has the name
scsi_requeue_command().

Thanks,
