I feel this was burried in the 00 email, shouldn't it go into the 01
commit changelog so that you can see this?

But why does the "cycle" matter here?

Can you run a normal benchmark, like fio, on here so we can get some
numbers we know how to compare to other systems with, and possible
reproduct it ourselves?  I'm sure fio will easily show random read
performance increases, right?

thanks,

greg k-h
