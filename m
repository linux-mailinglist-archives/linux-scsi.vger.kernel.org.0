Sure, I can move it so it's only in blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() and
blk_mq_do_dispatch_ctx().  That would definitely make it so that I
can't reproduce problems anymore, at least.

The one thing that worries me is that I couldn't come up with a
convincing argument about why the race wasn't possible when we put the
budget in blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list() and __blk_mq_try_issue_directly().
Perhaps you can explain.  In blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list() I can see that
we will call blk_mq_run_hw_queue() or blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue(), but
I guess I'm at least slightly worried that we'd also need to kick the
other "hctx"s on the same queue.  In theory holding budget could have
block those as well.  Do we care?  Maybe we should always assume that
the scheduler has a global queue across all "hctx"s?

Assuming we care about supporting schedulers that don't have a global
scheduler queue, it seems important to kick all the queues.  However,
if you tell me that all the code is already assuming a global
scheduler code then I can change my code to assume that too.

OK, thanks for confirming.  If you tell me that we should assume that
all IO schedulers have a global scheduler queue then I'll add the
has_work() check back in.  Otherwise I'll leave it as-is.
