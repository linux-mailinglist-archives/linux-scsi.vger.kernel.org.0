It's a bit proprietary for an open collaboration.  If it's just you and
a few UFS developers using it to co-ordinate, that's perfectly fine:
you can post a summary when it's decided.  If you really want random
community people to contribute, then it should probably be an etherpad
or wiki.  Etherpads are easier because lots of people publicly host
them:

https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/Sites-that-run-Etherpad-Lite

Wikimedia looks to be the one least likely to vanish after use.

Heh, don't we all ...
