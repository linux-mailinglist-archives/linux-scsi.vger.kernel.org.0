This is a curious overstatement in my testing now but in subtle ways.
The skinny is that this helps *older* kernels when the refcnt is 0.

Turns out that although for linux-next your patch really rarely makes a
difference, on older kernels (by backporting it mysef, say a 5.3
kernel), I see the benefit to your patch when the module refcnt is 0 and
after fstests generic/108 on xfs. Without your patch even if refcnt is 0
you must wait over 6 seconds before you can issue an rmmod if you want
it to suceed with a failure rate of about 1/1026.

In cooking up my fstests patches then, what would be helpful is if you
modified your patch so that it introduces a u32 debugfs file which
userspace can then query if it exits. It would use this to tell if the
quiescing effort is present. Since, this is likely to get better over time,
perhaps have it reflect a version for improvements.

This way if this patch is *not* merged, we'd have to sleep for over 6
seconds if you want a higher failure rate on certain tests.

That said, looking at test generic/108 on v5.3 with xfs with the
xfs_nocrc_512 configuration (-m crc=0,reflink=0,rmapbt=0, -i sparse=0,
-b size=512) should give you an idea of what might be left to do, so
that delays before rmmod can be trimmed further.

To be clear: the delays *are not* needed on linux-next, but on older
kernels they are. This might be telling of some races possible on older
kernels where module removal is *not* possible even though the refcnt is 0.

I'll mention this on my fstests patches.
