HDD. performance is very sensitive to IO order. Could you provide some
background info about NVMe HDD? Such as:

- number of hw queues
- hw queue depth
- will NVMe sort/merge IO among all SQs or not?

IO merge is often important for HDD. IO merge is usually triggered when
.queue_rq() returns STS_RESOURCE, so far this condition won't be
triggered for NVMe SSD.

Also blk-mq kills BDI queue congestion and ioc batching, and causes
writeback performance regression[1][2].

What I am thinking is that if we need to switch to use independent IO
path for handling SSD and HDD. IO, given the two mediums are so
different from performance viewpoint.
