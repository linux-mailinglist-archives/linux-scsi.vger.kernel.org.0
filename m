quick and dirty patch to fix the issue

On a large array (>15 drives), it is impossible to backup the storage to a SAS
tape without the driver detecting a lockup, and causing a bus reset.
This seems to be a false detection, as the host controller actually is not
locking up anything.  It's just a bit delayed.
This issue seems to go back to 4.14.

I reverted some cleanup stuff introduced in 4.14, and the driver is working
correctly.

I attached a patch for it, but this is just to show where the bug may be, it is
not ready for production (though it works, but this may be for 7 series only). 
I also have no idea what exactly causes this issue

Bug observed on a series 7 controller with a 12-drive RAID6 array.
