Another reviewer (called James) didn't like #ifdef_s (at file scope).

Surely it is simpler to allow an experienced C programmer to add

#define DEBUG 1
   or
#define SG_DEBUG 1

to the driver source code than to add to the existing Linux config
nightmare with a new config parameter:
   CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG_DEBUG

$ grep "^CONF" <linux-stable>/.config | wc
2480

on my system.
Linux: where too much is never enough.

Separate patch maybe :-)

Well I find it useful as I spend a fair bit of time re-reading
my code. To me a dozen upper case letters is easier to decode
than a sea of parentheses.

And the tide is moving back against "unsigned" types, at least in
C++. It is now regarded as a mistake the way STL introduced lots
of "unsigned" types and they are looking at whether they can move
some of them back to int.
Closer to home, I use ints wherever possible and the kernel seems
to favour them with negated errno return values. However the compiler
mindlessly warns about signed/unsigned comparisons when an int is
compared to a sizeof(). [If it had half a brain, it would check the
_value_ of the sizeof, and realize that often, even on an 8 bit
machine, there is no reason for the warning.]

Then there is the "Fortran rule" in checkpatch.pl (i.e. no lines
than 80 characters). "(int)sizeof(struct sg_io_hdr)" is 30 characters
long and that length often pushes simple conditionals like:
     if (A > B)
onto two lines which IMO is stupid.
