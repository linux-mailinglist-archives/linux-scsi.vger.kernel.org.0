Would the polling you need to do be similar to the vhost net poll code 
like in vhost_net_busy_poll (different algorithm though)? But, we want 
to be able to poll multiple devs/vqs from the same CPU right? Something 
like:

retry:

for each poller on CPU N
	if poller has work
		driver->run work fn

if (poll limit hit)
	return
else
	cpu_relax();
goto retry:

?

If so, I had an idea for it. Let me send an additional patch on top of 
this set.
