Thanks Lee, I will check it out.
The issues I was having are mainly qla2xxx target in the kernel, and I
had been working with Marvell to stabilize that in upstream.
various lockups and other workqueue relateed issues. It been a while.
I will try latest upstream and see if its any better than it was for me
a couple years back.
