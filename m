Hi Avri
Thanks, appreciate you shared your position on this topic. I don't know
how I can convince you to change your opinion.
Let me try.

1. HPB 2.0 is not out of scope.
HPB 1.0 only supports 4KB read length, which is useless. I don't know
if there will be users who want to use HPB driver only supports 4KB
chunk size. I think, we all know that some smartphone vendors have
already use HPB 2.0, even HPB 2.0 has not been released yet. you
mentioned this in your before emails. HPB 1.0 is just a
transition(limited) version, we need to think about the HPB 2.0 support
when we develop the HPB 1.0 driver.
To say the least, if we don't think about HPB 2.0 support, and just
focus HPB 1.0, in the end, after HPB 2.0 releasing, we need to return
original point, re-do lots thing, why we cannot fix it now and think
one step further.

2. The major goal of the HPB feature is to improve random read
performance, and HPB device mode implementing flow is now already very
clear enough. I don't know what the functional flows you mentioned.
if it is HPB host mode, no, this is another big topic, I think we'd
better not add in current driver until we all have a final approach.

3. Regarding the Daejun's HPB driver used age, I can't easily jump to a
conclusion. But for sure, before he disclosed his HPB driver and
submitted to the community, he did lots of changes and deletions. That
means it still needs lots of tests.


I didn't mean to disrupt Daejun's patch upstreaming. If Daejun can
consider HPB 2.0 support while developing HPB 1.0 patch, that is super.
Thus we can quickly add HPB 2.0 support once HPB 2.0 Spec released.
Think about that who is now using HPB 1.0?

Thanks,
Bean
