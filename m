Hi David,

SELECT REPORT field can be used for vVOL (LU conglomerate) discovery and
for well-known lun listing.

The field is used by VMware ESXi:
https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/VMware_Platform_Guide/User_Guides_for_VMware_Solutions/Virtual_Volumes_User_Guide/vVols_User_Guide%3A_Protocol_Endpoints

"PEs greatly extend the number of vVols that can be connected to an ESXi
cluster; each PE can have up to 16,383 vVols per host bound to it
simultaneously. Moreover, a new binding does not require a complete I/O
rescan. Instead, ESXi issues a REPORT_LUNS SCSI command with SELECT
REPORT to the PE to which the sub-lun is bound. The PE returns a list of
sub-lun IDs for the vVols bound to that host. In large clusters,
REPORT_LUNS is significantly faster than a full I/O rescan because it is
more precisely targeted."

The post also confirms that:
https://sourceforge.net/p/scst/mailman/message/33030432/

A few more targets that support SELECT REPORT field below.

Sun/Oracle tape library:

With regards to bumping TCM to SPC-4, are there any objections if we
submit a separate patch for that? Or resubmit a series with the patch?

Thanks,
Roman
