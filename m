I'm talking about PuiS.  At least with my 10 year old WD 1 TB blue
drives, if I enable PuiS, the drive will not spin up if you give it a
READ or VERIFY command, you have to give it the SET FEATURES command.
The kernel currently does this when it sees the drive requires it.

I believe the idea of "reset" here within the context of the ATA spec is
the reset bit in the ATA TaskFile, not a hardware reset, or even an SATA
link reset.  Those genereally DO spin up the disk unless it has PuiS enabled.

I'd prefer to be able to avoid spinning up disks on system resume, but
my point was that if you want it to spin up, a VERIFY command might not
work.  For some drives with PuiS enabled, you have to use the SET
FEATURES command to spin it up.

The kernel at least currently issues the SET FEATURE command to wake a
drive with PuiS enabled, if it says that it needs that.  I hope this
patch series does not break that.
