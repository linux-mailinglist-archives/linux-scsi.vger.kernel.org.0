Ah yes, I see what you mean.

Not quite sure, but it doesn't matter.  Removing BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT in 
__scsi_execute() is probably not a safe thing to do.

Instead, look at sd_resume().  That routine calls __scsi_execute() 
indirectly through sd_start_stop_device(), and the only reason it does 
this is because the sdkp->device->manage_start_stop flag is set.  You 
ought to be able to clear this flag in sysfs, by writing to 
/sys/block/sda/device/scsi_disk/*/manage_start_stop.  If you do this 
before allowing the card reader to go into runtime suspend, does it then 
resume okay?

(Yes, I know you still won't be able to read it because of the FAILFAST 
flag.  I just want to know if the runtime resume actually takes place.)
