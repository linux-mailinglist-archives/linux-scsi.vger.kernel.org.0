Ok. Interesting. We don't really care about the state of the rport when
sending TMFs or Aborts, as those commands are sent outside the normal
queuecommand flow (we just check "internal bits"), in case of Aborts we even
hand this off to firmware. Consequently we don't really care about their state
before trying to send either.

Ye, Ack. We can't control Fabric events.

Ok, so that would mean, we finish all commands left in the EH work_q with
`scsi_eh_finish_cmd()`, and not populate the local `check_list` at all, which
in turns means, we don't do anything in `scsi_eh_test_devices()` (no state
checks, not TURs).

When returning to `scsi_unjam_host()` directly after we return from
`scsi_eh_host_reset()` we call into `scsi_eh_flush_done_q()` and go over all
commands that are now in the done-queue (everything, if host reset returned
FAST_IO_FAIL).

In there we delete the commands from the EH list, and then check whether we
ought to retry the command on the same SDEV or return it to some upper layer
(i.e. hopefully dm-multipath for our installations).

The former depends on whether the SDEV is online again. If everything is fine
in the SAN (not cable pulled or something), I think this should be the case,
but IFF we assume the rport is still blocked because the async registration
(`zfcp_scsi_rport_work()`) hasn't finished yet (the original point for using
`fc_block_scsi_eh()`), then the SDEV might still be in state
SDEV_TRANSPORT_OFFLINE.
    This can happen during adapter recovery (where we block, IOW call
`fc_remote_port_delete()` on all rports) if fast-io-fail-tmo runs out, and
`fc_terminate_rport_io()` is called.
    That is undone when we call `fc_remote_port_add()` to 'unblock' the rport.
This would then set all SDEVs into RUNNING again. And there we have the
interaction with `fc_block_scsi_eh()` again.

Hmm. I think I could life with both though. If someone drives I/O directly on
the SDEV, and it fails after EH because of some unfortunate timing, that's bad
luck, and something was actually wrong in the SAN if fast-io-fail-tmo runs out
during recovery. They ought to use dm-multipath.
    And if they do, the commands are re-issued from that layer. I think that
should be fine.

So I think we can work with returning FAST_IO_FAIL from
`zfcp_scsi_eh_host_reset_handler()`, and removing the call to
`fc_block_scsi_eh()`.
    We (Steffen and/or I) might still want to look into some other solution
for only returning from that when we know the async rport registrations have
ran at least once after adapter recovery. But as far as your patchset goes, I
don't think that is a gate.
