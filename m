Urgent Urgent Urgent,
 
Please I need urgent assistance to move my late parents' money out of Ukraine to a safe place.
 

So many people are after my life because of this money because I am the only family left and I am now in one of the Ukraine borders and I don't know if I can make it because of my injuries.

 
For more information about the money,quickly get back to me with your name and direct phone number so that I can give to you the United Nations agent who I gave the safety cash Box to enable him deliver the money to you because I told him that someone will contact him for the safety Box in due time.
 

I shall be waiting to hear back from you ASAP.
 

Warm Regards,
Aros Alvaro.
