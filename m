Your position on this is not clear on this one.

 From an earlier mail [0] I got the impression that you tested on an arm 
platform â€“ did you?

I just don't know for certain that this is a card issue or an issue with 
the driver issue or both. I have a strong feeling that it is a driver 
issue. As I mentioned, v4.11 seems to work much better than v5.16 - on 
v4.11 I can mount the filesystem and copy files, which is not possible 
on a new kernel.

IIRC I did use this same card on an x86 platform some time and it worked 
ok, but I can't be certain. And it's really painful for me to swap the 
card to an x86 machine to test.

Your list looks ok. However I did also mention these logs which I saw on 
my arm machine:

[   12.160631] sas: target proto 0x0 at 500e004aaaaaaa1f:0x10 not handled
[   12.167183] sas: ex 500e004aaaaaaa1f phy16 failed to discover

They are red flags, and may be related to 2, above.

Thanks,
John
