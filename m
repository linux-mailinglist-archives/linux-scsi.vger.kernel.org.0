I guess this problem should be BFQ specific. Now there is definitely
requests in BFQ queue wrt. this hctx. However, looks this request is
only available from another loser thread, and it won't be retrieved in
the winning thread via e->type->ops.dispatch_request().

Just wondering why BFQ is implemented in this way?

No, it really hurts performance by adding one per-sdev spinlock in fast path,
and we actually tried to kill the atomic variable of 'sdev->device_busy'
for high performance HBA.
