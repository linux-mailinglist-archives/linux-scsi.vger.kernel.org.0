Yeah, and I rejected that patch too, no wonder you didn't include me in
further patch reviews, you didn't want me to reject them either :)

From the maintainers file:
	DYNAMIC DEBUG
	M:      Jason Baron <jbaron@akamai.com>
	S:      Maintained
	F:      include/linux/dynamic_debug.h
	F:      lib/dynamic_debug.c

Come on, you know this, don't try to avoid the people who have to
maintain the code you are wanting to change, that's not ok.

But that's not what the kernel is supposed to be doing, it doesn't care
about tracking things outside of the lifetime from when it can see a
device.  That's what userspace is for.

That's not ok, again, if you really want something crazy like this, then
modify your logging messages to provide it.  But I would strongly argue
that you do not really need this, as you have this information at
runtime, in userspace, already.

"over time" is not the kernel's responsibility.

This comes up every 5 years or so. The kernel provides you, at runtime,
a mapping between a hardware device and a "logical" device.  It can
provide information to userspace about this mapping, but once that
device goes away, the kernel is free to reuse that logical device again.

If you want to track what logical devices match up to what physical
device, then do it in userspace, by parsing the log files.  All of the
needed information is already there, you don't have to add anything new
to it.

Again, this comes up every few years for some reason, because people
feel it is eaasier to modify the kernel than work with userspace
programs.  Odd...

Again, solve this in userspace, you have the information there at
runtime, why not use it?

But one moment later you do have the information, so you can properly
correlate it, right?

No need to delay logging, you are looking at things way later in time,
so there's no issue of race conditions or anything else.
