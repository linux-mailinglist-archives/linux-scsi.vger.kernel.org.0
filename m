If you have hand-on experiences on NoC and/or OCP issues, you won't ask
for the crash log. The tricky parts about critial NoC and OCP issues is
that they don't print much logs (maybe no logs at all) in uart, which is
why they are hard to debug and why I add another flag to help debug.

Take OCP as an example, when OCP happens on VCCQ/VCCQ2, PMIC will do a
hard reset and put the system to crash dump mode (this is a general 
design
in our mutual customers, but it may vary platform by platform).

And if you have a crash dump tool to collect the dump, after the dump is
parsed, the best part which you can count on is the last callstacks and
related flags, variables in hba. The callstack is pretty much same with
the one I shared with my debug patch applied during the weekend.

Stanley can correct me if I am wrong.
