Okay. May I suggest a "FIX_ME" comment? And again, please don't open code it.

In driver manuals Seagate often list the PRE-FETCH command as optional. As
in: pay us some extra money and we will put it in. That suggests to me some
big OEM likes PRE-FETCH. Where I found it supported in WDC manuals, they
didn't support the IMMED bit which sort of defeats the purpose of it IMO.
