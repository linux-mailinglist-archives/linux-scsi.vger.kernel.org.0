Right, I did consider this.

I think that there is a way to circumvent the problem, which you might 
call hacky, but OTOH, not sure if there's much point changing mbigen or 
related infrastructure at this stage.

Anyway, so we have 128 irqs in total for the mbigen domain, but the 
driver only is interesting in something like irq indexes 1,2,72-81, and 
96-112. So we can just dispose the mappings for irq index 0-112 at 
removal stage, thereby keeping the its device around. We do still call 
platform_irq_count(), which sets up all 128 mappings, so maybe we should 
be unmapping all of these - this would be the contentious part. But 
maybe not, as the device driver is only interested in that subset, and 
has no business unmapping the rest.

With that change, the platform.c API would work a bit more like the pci 
msi code equivalent, where we request a min and max number of vectors. 
In fact, that platform.c change needs to be made anyway as 
platform_get_irqs_affinity() is broken currently for when nr_cpus < #hw 
queues.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
John
