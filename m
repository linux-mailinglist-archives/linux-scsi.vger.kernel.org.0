Reverting that patch would be a step backwards because it would make it 
again possible that the SCSI EH and UFS EH run concurrently and obstruct 
each other.

Does the above mean that "if (hba->pm_op_in_progress)" should be removed 
from the following code in ufshcd_queuecommand()?

	case UFSHCD_STATE_EH_SCHEDULED_FATAL:
		if (hba->pm_op_in_progress) {
			hba->force_reset = true;
			set_host_byte(cmd, DID_BAD_TARGET);
			cmd->scsi_done(cmd);
			goto out;
		}

Thanks,

Bart.
