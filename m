Agreed, a private counter should be good enough.

I was more concerned about the functional issue discovered in the
earlier patch and provided mine as an alternative without any side
effect or functional issue, since it does not modify any core logic.
Having said that, if your latest patch goes through and is accepted,
then agree that my patch is not needed. If however, some issue is
discovered in your latest patch, then I would request my patch to be
considered as an alternative, so that the device_busy counter overhead
can be avoided

In fast path, all cpu increment/decrement their own counter. In relatively =
slow path. they call scsi_device_busy function to get the total no of IO ou=
tstanding on a device. Only functional aspect it changes is that for non-ro=
tating media, the number of IO to a device is not restricted. Controllers w=
hich can handle that, can set the use_per_cpu_device_busy flag in scsi_host=
_template to take advantage of this patch. Other controllers need not modif=
y any code and would work as usual.

I added the NONROT check just as an afterthought. This patch is
designed for high end controllers, and most of them have some storage
IO size limit. Also, for HDD sequential IO is almost always large and
touch the controller max IO size limit. Thus, I am not sure merge
matters for these kind of controllers. Database use REDO log and small
sequential IO, but those are targeted to SSDs, where latency and IOPs
are far more important than IO merging.
Anyway, this patch is opt-in for drivers, so any LLD that cannot take
advantage of the flag need not set it, and would work as-is.
I can provide a new version of the patch with this check removed
