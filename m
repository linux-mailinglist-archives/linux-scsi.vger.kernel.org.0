That is what I suspected. However, checking the code, reset_store() in
pci-sysfs.c does:

	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
	result = pci_reset_function(pdev);
	pm_runtime_put(dev);

and pm_runtime_get_sync() calls __pm_runtime_resume() which will resume a
suspended device.

So while I still think it is not a good idea to reset a suspended device, things
should still work as execpected and not cause any problem with the device state,
right ?

Yihang,

I think that the issue at hand here is that once the reset finishes, the
controller goes back to suspended state, and I suspect that is because of the
"auto" setting for its power/control. That triggers because the FLR is done
after the controller resumed but *before* the revalidation of the drives
connected to it completes. So FLR makes the revalidation fail (scsi
scan/revalidation is asynchronous...).

This seems to me to be the expected behavior for what you are doing and I fail
to see how that ever worked correctly, even before 0c76106cb975 and 626b13f015e0.

Could you try this: add a call to msleep(30000) at the end of _resume_v3_hw(). I.e.:

diff --git a/drivers/scsi/hisi_sas/hisi_sas_v3_hw.c
b/drivers/scsi/hisi_sas/hisi_sas_v3_hw.c
index feda9b54b443..54224568d749 100644
--- a/drivers/scsi/hisi_sas/hisi_sas_v3_hw.c
+++ b/drivers/scsi/hisi_sas/hisi_sas_v3_hw.c
@@ -5104,6 +5104,8 @@ static int _resume_v3_hw(struct device *device)

        dev_warn(dev, "end of resuming controller\n");

+       msleep(30000);
+
        return 0;
 }

To see if it makes any difference to actually wait for the connected disks to
resume correctly before doing the FLR.
