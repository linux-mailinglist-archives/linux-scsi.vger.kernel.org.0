The patchset I mentioned doesn't split tagset. The patch just
converts SCSI's reply queue into blk_mq hw queue, and all hw queues
share the host-wide tags. You can get unique tag too.

This way isn't very different with the current single hw queue(tags),
that is why I think the performance shouldn't be bad compared with
the current single hw queue. Meantime, drivers can get simplified.

Actually it is global tags.
