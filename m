I like your idea, and I think it might even be made slightly simpler.

I assume sg3_utils requires CHR_DEV_SG. Is it the case?

If so, we would just need to enable SCSI_PROC_FS when CHR_DEV_SG is enabled.

Would that work for you?
I checked that SCSI_PROC_FS=y whether CHR_DEV_SG=y or m
I can spin a v2, with a blurb about how sg3_utils relies on SCSI_PROC_FS.

The rationale was just to look for "special-purpose" options that are
enabled by default, and change the default wherever possible, as a
matter of uniformity.

Any relation between SG and BSG?
