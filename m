Wrt. .cmd_per_lun, I think it is safe to modify it into one correct
depth because almost all drivers are just producer of .cmd_per_lun. And
except for debug purpose, there are only three consumers of .cmd_per_lun
in scsi, and all are for scsi_change_queue_depth():

	process_message()
	scsi_alloc_sdev()
	virtscsi_change_queue_depth()


Thanks,
Ming
