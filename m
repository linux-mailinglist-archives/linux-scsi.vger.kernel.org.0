John, thank you very much for taking the time to point this out. The 
commit showed first up in Linux 5.5-rc1. (The host template flog 
`host_tagset` was introduced in Linux 5.10-rc1.)

As we only have production systems with this issue, and Don wrote the 
Microchip team was able to reproduce the issue, it’d be great, if Don 
and his team, could test, if commit 6eb045e092ef introduced the regression.

Also, we still need a path forward how to fix this for the Linux 5.10 
series. Due to the issue dragging on for so long, the 5.9 series has 
reached end of life already.


Kind regards,

Paul
