In my use case I have no slot information.  I have no SCSI enclosure
services to toggle identification LEDs or fault LEDs for the drive sled.
 For some users the device might be a virtual one in a storage server,
vpd helps.

In my case the in kernel vpd (WWN) data can be used to correlate with
the sticker on the disk as the disks have the WWN printed on them.  I
would think this is true for most disks/storage devices, but obviously I
can't make that statement with 100% certainty as I have a small sample size.

How does /dev/disk/by-* help when you are looking at the journal from 1
or more reboots ago and the only thing you have in your journal is
something like:

blk_update_request: critical medium error, dev sde, sector 43578 op
0x0:(READ) flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 0

The links are only valid for right now.
