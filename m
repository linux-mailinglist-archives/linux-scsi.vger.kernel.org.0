Hi James,

thanks for getting back on this issue.

I have tested this patch for over a year and it works flawlessly
without any data corruption !

On such kind of drives the actual situation is just the opposite as you
describe: data corruption occurs when not using this patch !

I do not agree with you: if a drive does not support Synchronize Cache
command, there is no point in treating the failure as critical and by
all means the failure must be ignored, as there is nothing which can be
done about it and it should not be treated as a failure !

However, if you are willing to propose an alternative patch, I'd be
happy to test it and report back, as long as this bug is fixed in the
shortest time possible.

Guido
