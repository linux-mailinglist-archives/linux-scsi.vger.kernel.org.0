This patch still works even though the only clocksource is jiffies.

From the code of kernel/irq/timing.c:

1) record_irq_time() only records the start time of one irq, and not
consider the time taken in interrupt handler, so we can't figure out
the real interval between two do_IRQ() on one CPU

2) irq/timing doesn't cover softirq

Daniel, could you take a look and see if irq flood detection can be
implemented easily by irq/timing.c?
