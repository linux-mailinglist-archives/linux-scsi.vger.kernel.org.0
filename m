Hi Kars,

thanks for your patch!

I can't remember the details, but as far as I recall it, the Oktagon 
used pseudo-DMA rather than hardware DMA. At the time I started porting 
Zorro ESP drivers to the new core, pseudo-DMA code was available for Mac 
only, and no PIO transfer for data phases at all, so I decided to leave 
that out altogether.

Might be a lot easier now that Finn has moved the PIO support code into 
the core driver. Someone could start with a PIO mode driver and add PDMA 
later.

I wonder what max. transfer size had been used so far, in the majority 
of cases. I hadn't observed this bug in my tests of the ESP driver on 
elgar. So it might not matter so much in practice.

If we can differentiate between the Mark IV board and the Mark II board 
in a reliable way, fine. I can't remember whether I've had a report on 
that ever.

I'd suggest to change the transfer size limit to 60k in the first 
instance, and add board-specific tweaks as needed when you add 24 bit 
DMA support for the Mark IV.

Cheers,
