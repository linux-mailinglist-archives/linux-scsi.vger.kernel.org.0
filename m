That would be a change in behaviour.
Current code doesn't check for CONDITION_MET, so this change shouldn't 
do it, neither. Idea was that this patchset shouldn't change the current 
behaviour.

While your argument might be valid, it definitely is a different story 
and would need to be address with a different patchset.
