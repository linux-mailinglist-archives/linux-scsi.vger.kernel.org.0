Please use the upstream function names when posting upstream patches. I think that
ufshcd_wb_ctrl() has been renamed into ufshcd_wb_toggle().

So the deadlock is caused by nested locking - one task holding a reader lock, another
task calling down_write() and next the first task grabbing the reader lock recursively?
I prefer one of the following two solutions above the patch that has been posted since
I expect that both alternatives will result in easier to maintain UFS code:
- Fix the down_read() implementation. Making down_read() wait in case of nested locking
   seems wrong to me.
- Modify the UFS driver such that it does not lock hba->clk_scaling_lock recursively.

Thanks,

Bart.
