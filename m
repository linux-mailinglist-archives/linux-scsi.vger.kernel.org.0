Have you already had a look at the /dev/disk/by-path directory? An 
example of the contents of that directory:

$ (cd /dev/disk/by-path && ls -l | grep /s)
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Oct  3 16:49 pci-0000:00:02.0-ata-1 -> ../../sda
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Oct  3 16:49 pci-0000:00:08.0-scsi-0:0:0:1 -> 
../../sr0

Have you considered to use these soft links in /etc/fstab?

In case using these links would be impractical: have you considered to 
add a udev rule that creates H:C:I:L soft links under a subdirectory of 
/dev, that makes these soft links point at the /dev/sd* device nodes and 
to use these soft links in /etc/fstab? That's probably a much more 
elegant solution than what has been proposed above.

As one can see the information that is needed to implement such a udev 
rule is already available in sysfs:

$ (cd /sys/class/scsi_device && ls -ld */device/block/*)
drwxr-xr-x 9 root root 0 Oct  3 16:48 2:0:0:1/device/block/sr0
drwxr-xr-x 9 root root 0 Oct  3 16:48 3:0:0:0/device/block/sda
