"Random" is in the eye of the beholder. Take sg_new_write(), 20
years ago that referred to the newly introduced v3 interface. Its
a bit misleading to leave that name in place when the whole point
of the patchset is to add the v4 interface.

I don't understand why reviewers don't defer to a driver author and/or
maintainer in the cases of function and variable names. 20 years of
pigeonhole patches and kernel interface changes corrupt the original
naming and style of a driver. There are more significant things to
criticize if one looked deeper.
