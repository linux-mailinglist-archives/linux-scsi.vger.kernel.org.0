Got it now, thx.

Sounds really great. 

Any thought or plan for those callsites in other places? Possibly we can
skip those s390 related drivers since s390 only has DMA zone, no DMA32,
it should be OK.

And could you please also add me to CC when send out these patches? We
have this problem in our RHEL8 which is based on kernel4.18, if finally
removing dma-kmalloc(), we need back port these driver fixes too. If
not paying attention, these patches may scatter in different
sub-components and unnoticable.
