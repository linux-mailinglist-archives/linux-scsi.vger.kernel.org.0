No, I'm not suggesting that. I'm aware of strange I/O monitoring chips valu=
es
and the lack of documentation, so in this case, something is better
than nothing.

In the nvme case, these are only 2 values who either are working/supported
by firmware or not, so I thought it would be reasonable to have
known-good values
instead of 65261.8=C2=B0C, which will probably cause users to report that
as a bug a lot.

Can we at least have that documented and explain how the values can be
set/changed?
