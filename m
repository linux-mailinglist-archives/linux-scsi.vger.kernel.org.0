I looked through your two traces.  Unfortunately they don't help --
they are essentially identical.  Exactly the same sequence of commands
was sent to the device in both traces, except for a couple of
inconsequential TEST UNIT READY commands.

There are some timing differences, but they occur in between commands,
not during a command.  They probably are the times you spent typing
stuff into the terminal.

Can you run another test?  Similar to the last one, but this time start
collecting the usbmon trace at least 10 seconds after the drive is
plugged in.  Then mount the drive, copy a small file (say less than 500
bytes) to it, unmount it, and then stop the trace.
