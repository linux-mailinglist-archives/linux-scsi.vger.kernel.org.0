As outlined in the response to Ming, the problem is the ioctl path.
When called from ioctl we do _not_ have a valid command, hence drivers 
have to figure out if the command is valid (ie coming from SCSI EH), or 
invalid (ie coming from ioctl).
I'm trying to unify both call paths by having the SCSI EH functions to 
always allocate a (reserved) SCSI command.

I have not moved this into the caller, as using a reserved command 
requires modifications of the driver itself (at least by setting 
'nr_reserved_cmds').

Also, the above approach does not work when we run into a command 
timeout; which, from my experience, is the majority of cases.
For timeout commands we precisely can _not_ re-use the command tag, as 
the command itself is still assumed live somewhere (otherwise we could 
have aborted it, and we wouldn't have to call the EH functions...).
But that means that any associated resources (like FC oxids) are still 
active on the wire, and re-using them would actually be a violating of 
the spec.

Cheers,

Hannes
