Hi Ming,

HiSilicon SAS HBA can accept 4096 commands on any given hw queue but can 
also only accept 4096 commands over all queues simultaneously.  In fact, 
the hw queue depth is configurable.

That's why I think that the definition is misleading.

I think I sound like a broken record now :)

at least that is the

ok, seems reasonable for now.

TBH, I'm not sure on the group of SCSI drivers which could benefit then.

As I see, only qla2xxx driver sets Scsi_host.nr_hw_queues and also uses 
pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity().

ok, I'd rather not go on this path - you may say I'm digging my head in 
the sand. Anyway, I'll continue to support the 'improve blk-mq for CPU 
hotplug' effort.
