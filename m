It's true that Qualcomm based Android devices already use HW-wrapped keys on
SoCs earlier than SM8650.  The problem is that the key generation, import, and
conversion were added to Android's KeyMint HAL, as a quick way to get the
feature out the door when it was needed (so to speak).  Unfortunately this
coupled this feature unnecessarily to the Android KeyMint and the corresponding
(closed source) userspace HAL provided by Qualcomm, which it's not actually
related to.  I'd guess that Qualcomm's closed source userspace HAL makes SMC
calls into Qualcomm's KeyMint TA, but I have no insight into those details.

The new SMC calls eliminate the dependency on the Android-specific KeyMint.
They're also being documented by Qualcomm.  So, as this patchset does, they can
be used by Linux in the implementation of new ioctls which provide a vendor
independent interface to HW-wrapped key generation, import, and conversion.

I think the new approach is the only one that is viable outside the Android
context.  As such, I don't think anyone has any plan to upstream support for
HW-wrapped keys for older Qualcomm SoCs that lack the new interface.
