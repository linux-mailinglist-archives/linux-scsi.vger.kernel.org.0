I had actually given up on the delayed vq creation goal. I'm still not 
sure how it's related to ENABLE and I think it gets pretty gross.

1. If we started from a semi-clean slate, and used the ENABLE ioctl more 
like a CREATE ioctl, and did the ENABLE after vhost dev open() but 
before any other ioctls, we can allocate the vq when we get the ENABLE 
ioctl. This fixes the issue where vhost scsi is allocating 128 vqs at 
open() time. We can then allocate metadata like the iovecs at ENABLE 
time or when we get a setup ioctl that is related to the metadata, so it 
fixes that too.

That makes sense how ENABLE is related to delayed vq allocation and why 
we would want it.

If we now need to support old tools though, then you lose me. To try and 
keep the code paths using the same code, then at vhost dev open() time 
do we start vhost_dev_init with zero vqs like with the allocate at 
ENABLE time case? Then when we get the first vring or dev ioctl, do we 
allocate the vq and related metadata? If so, the ENABLE does not buy us 
a lot since we get the delayed allocation from the compat code. Also 
this compat case gets really messy when we are delaying the actual vq 
and not just the metadata.

If for the compat case, we keep the code that before/during 
vhost_dev_init allocates all the vqs and does the initialization, then 
we end up with 2 very very different code paths. And we also need a new 
modparam or something to tell the drivers to do the old or new open() 
behavior.

2. If we do an approach that is less invasive to the kernel for the 
compat case, and do the ENABLE ioctl after other vring ioctl calls then 
that would not work for the delayed vq allocation goal since the ENABLE 
call is too late.

That's one of the things I am trying to understand. It sounds like 
ENABLE is not useful to net. Will net even use/implement the ENABLE 
ioctl or just use the SET_BACKEND? What about vsock?

For net it sounds like it's just going to add an extra code path if you 
support it.

That is why I was asking about if you were going to change net.

It would have been useful for scsi if we had it when mq support was 
added and we don't have to support old tools. But now, if enable=true, 
is only going to be something where we set some bit so later when 
VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT is run it we can do what we are already doing 
its just extra code. This patch:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg150151.html
would work without the ENABLE ioctl I mean.


And if you guys want to do the completely new interface, then none of 
this matters I guess :)

For disable see below.

Some SCSI background in case it doesn't work like net:
-------
When the user sets up mq for vhost-scsi/virtio-scsi, for max perf and no 
cares about mem use they would normally set num_queues based on the 
number of vCPUs and MSI-x vectors. I think the default in qemu now is to 
try and detect that value.

When the virtio_scsi driver is loaded into the guest kernel, it takes 
the num_queues value and tells the scsi/block mq layer to create 
num_queues multiqueue hw queues.

------

I was trying to say in the previous email that is if all we do is set 
some bits to indicate the queue is disabled, free its resources, stop 
polling/queueing in the scsi/target layer, flush etc, it does not seem 
useful. I was trying to ask when would a user only want this behavior?

I think we need an extra piece where the guests needs to be modified to 
handle the queue removal or the block/scsi layers would still send IO 
and we would get IO errors. Without this it seems like some extra code 
that we will not use.

And then if we are going to make disable useful like this, what about 
enable? We would want to the reverse where we add the queue and the 
guest remaps the mq to hw queue layout. To do this, enable has to do 
more than just set some bits. There is also an issue with how it would 
need to interact with the SET_BACKEND 
(VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT/VHOST_SCSI_CLEAR_ENDPOINT for scsi) calls.

I think if we wanted the ENABLE ioctl to work like this then that is not 
related to my patches and I like I've written before I think my patches 
do not need the ENABLE ioctl in general. We could add the patch where we 
create the workers threads from VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT. And if we ever 
add this queue hotplug type of code, then the worker thread would just 
get moved/rearranged with the other vq modification code in 
vhost_scsi_set_endpoint/vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint.

We could also go the new threading interface route, and also do the 
ENABLE ioctl separately.
