Good catch!

This drain mechanism won't address the issue for these SCSI LLDDs in which:

	1) blk_mq_hw_ctx serves as submission hw queue

	2) one private reply queue serves as completion queue, for which one
	MSI vector with cpumask is setup via pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity(PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY).

What we should only drain is the completion queue if all its mapped
CPUs are offline.

Looks you suggest to expose all completion(reply) queues as 'struct blk_mq_hw_ctx',
which may involve in another more hard problem: how to split the single
hostwide tags into each reply queue. I'd rather not work towards that
direction because:

1) it is very hard to partition global resources into several parts,
especially it is hard to make every part happy.

2) sbitmap is smart/efficient enough for this global allocation

3) no obvious improvement is obtained from the resource partition, according
to previous experiment result done by Kashyap.

I think we could implement the drain mechanism in the following way:

1) if 'struct blk_mq_hw_ctx' serves as completion queue, use the
approach in the patch

2) otherwise:
- introduce one callbcack of .prep_queue_dead(hctx, down_cpu) to
'struct blk_mq_ops'

- call .prep_queue_dead from blk_mq_hctx_notify_dead() 

3) inside .prep_queue_dead():
- the driver checks if all mapped CPU on the completion queue is offline
- if yes, wait for in-flight requests originated from all CPUs mapped to
this completion queue, and it can be implemented as one block layer API

Any comments on the above approach?

Thanks,
Ming
