I agree, but I don't see what's wrong with that. Any context can invoke
ufs error handler asynchronously and ufs error handler prepare makes
sure error handler can work safely, i.e., stopping PM ops/gating/scaling
in error handler prepare makes sure no one shall call 
ufshcd_uic_pwr_ctrl()
ever again. And ufshcd_check_errors() and ufshcd_abort() are OK to run
concurrently with UFS error handler.

Sorry that I missed the change of scsi_transport_template() in your 
previous
message. I can understand that you want to invoke UFS error hander by 
invoking
SCSI error handler, but I didn't go that far because I saw you changed
pm_runtime_get_sync() to pm_runtime_get_noresume() in ufs error handler 
prepare.
How can that change make sure that the device is not suspending or 
resuming
while error handler is running?

Thanks,

Can Guo.
