Hi Bart,

Slightly revised my previous mail.

Please let me address your concern.

First of all, it is allowed to call scsi_device_quiesce() multiple 
times,
but one sdev's request queue's pm_only counter can only be increased 
once
by scsi_device_quiesce(), because if a sdev has already been quiesced,
in scsi_device_quiesce(), scsi_device_set_state(sdev, SDEV_QUIESCE) 
would
return -ENIVAL (illegal state transform), then blk_clear_pm_only() shall
be called to decrease pm_only once, so no matter how many times
scsi_device_quiesce() is called, it can only increase pm_only once.

scsi_device_resume() is same, it calls blk_clear_pm_only only once and
only if the sdev was quiesced().

So, in a word, after scsi_device_resume() returns in 
scsi_dev_type_resume(),
if a sdev has block layer runtime PM enabled (sdev->request_queue->dev 
is not
NULL), its queue's pm_only counter should be 1 (if the sdev's runtime 
power
status is RPM_SUSPENDED) or 0 (if the sdev's runtime power status is 
RPM_ACTIVE).
If a sdev has block layer runtime PM disabled (sdev->request_queue->dev 
is NULL),
its queue's pm_only counter should be 0.

Has it been considered to test directly whether a SCSI device has been
runtime suspended instead of relying on blk_queue_pm_only()? How about
using pm_runtime_status_suspended() or adding a function in
block/blk-pm.h that checks whether q->rpm_status == RPM_SUSPENDED?

Yes, I used to make the patch like that way, and it also worked well, as
both ways are equal actually. I kinda like the current code because we
should be confident that after scsi_dev_type_resume() returns, pm_only
must be 0. Different reviewers may have different opinions, either way
works well anyways.

Thanks,

Can Guo.
