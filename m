There is no risk that the scsi_cmnd.device member will be dereferenced for
internal requests allocated by the UFS driver. But I understand from your
email that making sure that the scsi_cmnd.device member is not NULL is
important for other SCSI LLDs. I will look into the approach of associating
a stub SCSI device with internal requests.

Thanks,

Bart.
