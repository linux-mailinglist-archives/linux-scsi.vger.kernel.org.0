I think that Hannes point was that if you ensure that the rejected regular write
commands used to emulate zone append when requeued go through the sd driver
again when resubmitted, they will be changed again to emulate the original zone
append using the latest wp location, which is assumed correct. And that does not
depend on the ordering. So requeuing these regular writes does not need sorting.
It can be in any order. The constraint is of course that they must be re-preped
from the original REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND every time they are requeued.
