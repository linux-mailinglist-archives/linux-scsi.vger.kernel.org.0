I have not paid any attention to this yet.  From what I can tell, the
problem was discovered by a test case (i.e., not reported by a
real-world user), it is not a recent regression, we haven't identified
a commit that introduced the problem, and we do not have a potential
fix for it.  Obviously it needs to be fixed and I'm not trying to
minimize the problem; I just want to calibrate it against everything
else.
