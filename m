Again, this might be answered somewhere, but why can't we use keyctl
for handling the keys and then use a single IOCTL to point the block
device to the key in the keyring?

Not in this patchset. The ICE driver decides whether it can support
HW-wrapped keys or not and then fails to support other type of keys.

I was mostly looking at the hardware-specific implementation.
