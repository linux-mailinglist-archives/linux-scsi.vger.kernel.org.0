Hi Dan.

I absolutely agree with all of your comments and I appreciate your review.
I agree that all of the issues you've pointed out, with the the exception of
one, need to be addressed. The issues pointed out - especially the string
manipulation issues - can turn into CVEs. We don't want to be checking bugs
like this into Linux. Certainly, nothing should be merged that does not
pass the static checker, et al, automated tools we have.

My comment here was only to say that I don't think it's reasonable to
ask Karan to break this change into a series of 100 small, reviewable changes.

To explain: the fnic driver is Cisco's driver. Cisco has always taken responsibility
for this driver and Karan is one of the many Cisco Maintainers. What's happening is,
after a long period of time where the code has been somewhat neglected, Cisco has
decided to do a major update of their upstream driver. These changes
are really more like a new driver, with some major new features, than a
series of bug fixes or updates. This is happening because - at the insistence
of some of the Distros, like Red Hat - Cisco is being told they need to bring
their upstream drivers in line with their out-of-box drivers.

Karan can confirm if this is the case. My question for Karan is: are there any more
major driver changes coming for fnic, or is this the majority of it?

If this were simply a new feature or a series of bug fixes I agree the changes
need to be organized into a series of small, reviewable patches. However,
under the circumstances, I am willing to hold my nose and say: just get your driver
updated and into order, and then we will hold the Maintainers (not Martin) accountable.

So I guess I am recommending an exception to the rule, just this once, in regard to breaking the
overall change into a smaller and smaller patch series. I would prefer, instead, that any and all
changes needed to address further review comments be presented as a small series of patches, broken
down into reviewable chunks, on top of the exiting patch series. It can be decided later if these
patches can or should be squashed into the respective 17 commits.

Anyways, those are my thoughts.

Thanks again for your help with this review. I agree Karan needs help and support,
and I will try to be more public about they ways I am doing that - which have been
mostly in the back-ground.

/John
