Yeah, I did that on purpose to give scsi_execute_cmd more control over
whether to retry or not. I think you are looking at this more like
we want to be able to retry when scsi-ml decided not to.

For example, I was thinking multipath related code like the scsi_dh handlers
would want to fail for cases scsi-ml was currently retrying. Right now they
are setting REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT but for most drivers that's not doing what
they think it does. Only DID_BUS_BUSY fast fails and I think the scsi_dh
failover code wants other errors like DID_TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED to fail so the
caller can decide based on something like the dm-multipath pg retries.

I think it's reverse of what you are thinking for the FAILED case
but I agree it's wrong (wrong but for different reasons).

If scsi_decide_disposition returns FAILED then runtime is bad, because
the scsi eh will start and then we have to wait for that.

The scsi_execute_cmd user can now actually bypass the EH for FAILED
so runtime will be shorter. However, I agree that it's wrong we can
bypass the EH because in some cases we need to kick the device or
cleanup cmds. So that should be fixed for sure and we should always
start the EH and go through that code path.

It looks like we had different priorities. I was trying to allow
scsi_execute_cmd to be able to override scsi-ml retries, and not just allow
us to retry if scsi-ml decided not to.

Given I messed up on the FAILED case above, I agree doing the less
risky approach is better now. We can change it for multipath some other
day.

I'm not sure what you are saying in the 2 paragraphs above.

We have:

1. scsi_execute_cmd users like read_capacity_10 which will retry the
device reset UA 10 times. Then it can retry that error 3 more time
(this was probably not intentional so can be ignored) and it can retry
any error other error except medium not present 3 times.

And then it calls scsi_execute_cmd with sdkp->max_retries so the scsi-ml
retried are whatever the user requested and 5 by default.

I think we wanted to keep this behavior.

2.  Then, for the initial device setup/discovery tests where the transport is
flakey during device discovery/setup, we can hit the DID_TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED
that multiple times, then we will get UAs after we relogin/reset the
transport/device. So I think we want to keep the behavior where a user
does

+       struct scsi_failure failures[] = {
+               {
+                       .sense = UNIT_ATTENTION,
+                       .asc = SCMD_FAILURE_ASC_ANY,
+                       .ascq = SCMD_FAILURE_ASCQ_ANY,
+                       .allowed = UA_RETRY_COUNT,
+                       .result = SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION,
+               },
+               {}
+       };


scsi_execute_cmd(.... $NORMAL_CMD_RETRIES)

then we can retry transport errors NORMAL_CMD_RETRIES then once those
settle still retry UAs UA_RETRY_COUNT times.

3. Then we have the cases where the scsi_execute_cmd user retried
multiple errors and in this patchset we used to retry a total of N
times, but now can retry each error up to N times. For this it sounds
like you want to code it so we only do a total of N times so the
behavior is the same as before.

To handle all these I think I need the extra allowed field on the
scsi_failures.
