There is the Bulk-Only Mass Storage Reset request, which is what 
usb-storage issues when asked to perform a device reset.  But few 
devices implement it correctly.

I think the best answer is to accept the patch that started this email 
thread, perhaps with a minor change.  The driver can easily abort the 
currently running command (if any) on its own before starting a reset.
