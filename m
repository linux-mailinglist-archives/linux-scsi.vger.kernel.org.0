OK, so dynamically allocating the sbitmap could be good. I was thinking 
previously that we still allocate for nr_cpus size, and search a limited 
range - but this would have heavier runtime overhead.

So if you really think that this may have some value, then let me know, 
so we can look to take it forward.
