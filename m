All the three counters are increased only, and you could use some simple bpf code
to retrieve such info easily. It adds such overhead for everyone, who may not use
this counters at all, maybe 99% of people don't use it.

Yeah, it can be fixed in this way, can you cook one such fix?

Longterm, maybe we can mark these sysfs interface as obsolete and let
existed users switch to ebpf, and finally remove them.
