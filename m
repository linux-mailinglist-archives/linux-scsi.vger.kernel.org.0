Actually I think it should do the real "enable/disable" that tries to 
follow the virtio spec.

(E.g both PCI and MMIO have something similar).

It's not necessarily to create or destroy kthread according to 
VRING_ENABLE but could be a hint.

This seems to leave the question to userspace which I'm not sure it's 
good since it tries to introduce another scheduling layer.

Per vq worker seems be good enough to start with.
