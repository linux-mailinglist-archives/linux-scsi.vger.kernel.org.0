Hi Christoph,

Thanks for the feedback...

I'm probably missing something, but having the (stack) completion
separate to the se_cmd and sense buffer would mean that it's no longer a
straightforward container_of() in the .check_stop_free() callback.

I've reworked this patch to put the entire xcopy_pt_cmd on the stack and
will send it out with v2.

Cheers, David
