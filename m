It doesn't matter. This patch only can't avoid the UAF too, we need
to grab req->ref to prevent queue from being frozen.

That means the 'rq' is re-allocated, and it becomes in-flight again.

No, When refcount_inc_not_zero() succeeds in bt_tags_iter(), no one can
free the request any more until ->fn() returns, why do you think memory
corrupts? This pattern isn't different with timeout's usage, is it?

If IO activity is allowed during iterating tagset requests, ->fn() and
in-flight IO can always be run concurrently. That is caller's
responsibility to handle the race. That is why you can see lots callers
do quiesce queues before calling blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter(), but
quiesce isn't required if ->fn() just READs request only.

Your patch or current in-tree code has same 'problem' too, if you think
it is a problem. Clearing ->rq[tag] or holding a lock before calling
->fn() can not avoid such thing, can it?

Finally it is a request walking in tagset wide, so it should be safe for
->fn to iterate over request in this way. The thing is just that req->tag may
become not same with 'bitnr' any more. We can handle it simply by checking
if 'req->tag == bitnr' in bt_tags_iter() after the req->ref is grabbed,
still not sure if it is absolutely necessary.


Thanks,
Ming
