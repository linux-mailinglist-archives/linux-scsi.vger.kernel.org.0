Yes, the only time I've see the POR UA not get passed to the st driver is with scsi_debug, when
the driver first loads.

There should be a UA right here.

I have no idea whey the scsi_debug driver doesn't support READ BLOCK LIMITS.

Another problem with using scsi_debug is:

[tape_tests]# sg_reset --target /dev/sg3

This does nothing.  I have to use the /dev/st device to reset.  This is not true if you have a real tape device.

[tape_tests]# sg_reset --target /dev/nst1

Agreed. There are some idiosyncrasies in the scsi_debug tape emulation. But I don't want those problems to make their way into 
the st driver. I don't think the st driver should be paying attention to was_reset, or anything else in the mid layer.

Please try my latest version of the tape_reset_debug.sh script.

https://github.com/johnmeneghini/tape_tests/blob/master/tape_reset_debug.sh

This test uses the scsi_debug driver with ptype=1 to test these patches using "sg_reset --target /dev/nst$i".

There is also the tape_reset_debug_sg.sh script. That script runs the same tests using "sg_reset --target /dev/sg$i"

They each give me different false negative and false positive results... but that may because of something I'm doing wrong.

OK, I will test those as soon as they show up.

And Thanks for your help fixing these bugs...
