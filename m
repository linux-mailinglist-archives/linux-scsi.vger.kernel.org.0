'Unavailable' state. Right.

Hmm. Seems that we need to distinguish (at the device-mapper multipath 
layer) between temporarily failed paths (like transitioning), which 
could become available at a later time, and permanently failed paths 
(like unavailable or standby), for which a retry would not yield 
different results. I thought we did that, but apparently there's an 
issue somewhere.

Lemme see ...

Cheers,

Hannes
