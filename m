Well, send_dma_cmd() always initializes those registers. That's fine in 
the DMA case and seems to be the least surprising and cleanest thing to do 
for the PIO case, I think.

I was alluding to an unpatched theoretical failure.

The issue would arise when a board driver indicated to the core driver 
that the requested transfer was too small. I'm assuming that it would do 
this by returning zero from esp->ops->dma_length_limit(), which puts us in 
the "DMA length is zero" code path.

The actual failure (that you patched) shows that your board isn't able to 
do short DMA transfers and would require PIO for that.

But this is a theoretical problem so far. You may need to use sg_utils to 
generate a SCSI command like that.

(For a DMA controller subject to, say, 24-bit boundaries, there are 
additional ways to end up with short transfers.)

Fair enough. That means a stale count could be used after a PIO transfer 
in DATA IN and DATA OUT phase that happened to follow a DMA transfer (in 
any phase).

I still think there is a opportunity to improve robustness and correctness 
(presuming that performance isn't impacted).
