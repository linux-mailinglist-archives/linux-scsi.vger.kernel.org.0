After the first device's shutdown method in device_shutdown has been
called there is now way back (we don't have an opposite to shutdown like
for suspend resume is) so it can't be undone and also it doesn't matter
if some structures remain in memory. To me it seems to be the only
logical consequence but I can't prove it.

Validate, I don't know how or what you mean. Making sure that everything
is in a state when the kernel shutdown procedure may be entered is for
example on my system done by userspace systemd-shutdown service like so
:"systemd-shutdown[1]: Syncing filesystems and block devices ..."
When the kernel shutdown procedure is entered the I/O will be cut off
abruptly by a LLD.shutdown. That means it depends on scripts like
systemd and that works well on all systems I checked for reboot but not
for kexec on everywhere.
The patch may stop the I/O few msec sooner that is true. But the clearer
 messages may bring a script writer to fix it.

The patch doesn't fix a real bug so it isn't urgent nor important,
seeing the congestion it creates please just drop it.
