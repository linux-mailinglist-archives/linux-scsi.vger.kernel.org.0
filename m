I am currently figuring out the 'correct' settings for passing the
various tests our partner does in their labs. That is no upstream udev
rules for this (yet).

Anyway, the settings are

  ACTION!="add|change", GOTO="tmo_end"
  # SCSI fc_remote_ports
  KERNELS=="rport-?*", SUBSYSTEM=="fc_remote_ports", ATTR{fast_io_fail_tmo}="5", ATTR{dev_loss_tmo}="4294967295"
  # nvme fabrics
  KERNELS=="ctl", SUBSYSTEMS=="nvme-fabrics", ATTR{transport}=="fc", ATTR{fast_io_fail_tmo}="-1", ATTR{ctrl_loss_tmo}="-1"
  LABEL="tmo_end"

and this works for lpfc but only half for qla2xxx.

Ah, didn't know about nvmediscovery until very recentetly. I try to get
it working with this approach (as this patch is not really a proper
solution).

So far I haven't had the need to distinguish between the two protocols
for the dev_loss_tmo setting. I think this is what Hannes was also
trying to tell, it might make sense to introduce sysfs APIs per
protocol.

As I said this patch was really a RFC. I will experiment with
nvmediscovery. Though, I think this is just a stopgap solution. Having
two completely different ways to configure the same thing is sub optimal
and it is asking for a lot of troubles with end customers. I am really
hoping we could streamline the current APIs, so we have only one
recommended way to configure the system independent of the driver
involved.

Thanks,
Daniel
