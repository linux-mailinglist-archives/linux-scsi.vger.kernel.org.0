Okok, I see your point.

Indeed the csiostor driver doesn't use the 'tag' per se for submitting 
commands; it's just using the scsi command pointer as a tag to figure 
out if a completion has been send from the hw.

I'll be giving it a bit more thought, and will be dropping it for the 
next round (which will contain only the minimal changes to get the 
'reserved_cmds' interface in).

Cheers,

Hannes
