*cough*

metadata Io needs to be set up, issued and completed before the
transaction can make progress, and then the transaction will hold
onto that metadata until it is committed and unlocked.

That means we hold every btree buffer we walk along a path in the
transaction, and if the cache is cold it means we might need to
allocate and read dozens of metadata buffers in a single
transaction.

What's atomic data writes got to do with metadata transaction
contexts?

Step outside of bcachefs for a minute, Kent. Not everything works
the same way or has the same constraints and/or freedoms as the
bcachefs implementation....

How do you mempoolify something that can have thousands of
concurrent contexts with in-flight objects across multiple
filesystems that might get stashed in a LRU rather than freed when
finished with? Not to mention that each context has an unknown
demand on the mempool before it can complete and return objects to
the mempool?

We talked about this a decade ago at LSFMM (2014, IIRC) with the MM
developers and nothing about mempools has changed since.

Our own internal memory allocation wrappers. go look at what remains
in fs/xfs/kmem.c. See the loop there in kmem_alloc()? It's
guaranteeing NOFAIL behaviour unless KM_MAYFAIL is passed to the
allocation. Look at xlog_kvmalloc() - same thing, except it is
always run within transaction context (the "xlog" prefix is a
giveaway) and so will block until allocation succeeds.

IOWs, we scoped everything by having our own internal allocation
wrappers than never fail. In removing these wrappers (which is where
my "scoped NOFAIL" comments in this thread originated from) the
proliferation of __GFP_NOFAIL annotations across meant we went from
pretty much zero usage of __GFP_NOFAIL to having almost a hundred
allocation sites annotated with __GFP_NOFAIL. And it adds a
maintenance landmine for us - we now have to ensure that all future
allocations within a transaction scope are marked __GFP_NOFAIL.

Hence I'm looking for ways to move this NOFAIL scoping into the
generic memory allocation code to replace the scoping we current
have via subsystem-specific allocation wrappers.

I never said it did - this part of the conversation was about the
failure prone design of proposed -NOWAIT- scoping, not about
trying to codify a generic mechanism for scoped behaviour we've been
using successfully for the past 20 years...

Tha all sounds good, but after a recent spate of "CI and post
integration testing didn't uncover fs bugs that fstests reproduced
until after tested kernels were released to test systems", I have
little confidence in the ability of larger QA organisations, let
alone individuals, to test filesystem code adequately when they are
constrained either by time or resources.

The fact of the matter is that we are all constrained by time
and resources. Hence adding more new testing methods that add time
and resources to validate new code and backports of fixes to the
test matrix overhead does nothing to improve that situation.

We need to start designing our code in a way that doesn't require
extensive testing to validate it as correct. If the only way to
validate new code is correct is via stochastic coverage via error
injection, then that is a clear sign we've made poor design choices
along the way.

-Dave.
