Hi Martin,
Please apply the changes to 5.11/scsi-queue at your earliest
convenience.

The series changes the behavior of the target in regard to processing
commands with overflow/underflow in accordance with the standarts.

The target driver used to process the DMA_TO_DEVICE commands with
residuals (in particular, WRITE command) incorrectly. The target
response contained neither a residual count, nor an OVERFLOW/UNDERFLOW
bit. Such behavior did not comply with the RFC 7143. Also the
returned ASC and ASCQ were incorrect according to FCP-4,
and residuals were not set for the 4Kn devices.

This patches fix the major inconsistances in processing these kind of
commands.

This patch series has been tested with a modified libiscsi testing
library.
The link to the pull request:
https://github.com/sahlberg/libiscsi/pull/345

Write10Residuals, Write12Residuals, Write16Residuals tests have passed.

Thanks,
Anastasia
