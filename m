I have not yet run any performance measurements because I expect that it
will be challenging to measure the performance impact of a change like
this one accurately. The performance measurement tool itself (e.g. fio)
might introduce more variation between runs than the performance
improvement of this patch series. Another reason I have not yet run any
performance measurements is because I was assuming that everyone would
be happy with a patch series that makes code faster and that reduces the
size of a key SCSI data structure.

Anyway, I have run 'make drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.lst' with and without
this patch series applied. What I see is that without this patch series
the assembly code for converting a SCSI command pointer into a request
pointer looks like this:

48 8b bb 10 01 00 00    mov    0x110(%rbx),%rdi

With this patch series applied that conversion code changes into the
following:

48 8d bb f0 fe ff ff    lea    -0x110(%rbx),%rdi

The above shows that struct request has a size of 0x110 = 272 bytes with
my kernel configuration.

This illustrates that this patch series realizes an improvement since
"mov" instructions used for converting SCSI command pointers into struct
request pointers are converted into "lea" instructions. "mov" fetches
data from memory while "lea" does not.

Bart.
