While adding the INFO return to tgt I noticed that it had the same
memcmp-with-miscompare-for-loop logic that you describe. I'm only aware
of ESXi as a COMPARE AND WRITE consumer and I think probability of
equality is quite high (@Dirk: perhaps you can confirm?).

I think this optimization wouldn't make the code much more complex, so
I'll do a re-spin with this change. Thanks for the feedback.

Cheers, David
