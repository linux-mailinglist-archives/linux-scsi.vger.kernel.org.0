I spent some time digging into this and also revisiting the possibility of using
an xarray. Conclusion is that this does not work well, at least in no way not
better than what I did, and most of the time much worse. The reason is that we
need at the very least to keep this information around:
1) If the zone is conventional or not
2) The zone capacity of sequential write required zones

Unless we keep this information, a report zone would be needed before starting
writing to a zone that does not yet have a zone write plug allocated.

(1) and (2) above can be trivially combined into a single 32-bits value. But
that value must exist for all zones. So at the very least, we need nr_zones * 4B
of memory allocated at all time. For such case (i.e. non-sparse structure),
xarray or hash table would be more costly in memory than a simple static array.

Given that we want to allocate/free zone write plugs dynamically as needed, we
essentially need an array of pointers, so 8B * nr_zones for the base structure.
From there, ideally, we should be able to use rcu to safely dereference/modify
the array entries. However, static arrays are not supported by the rcu code from
what I read.

Given this, my current approach that uses 16B per zone is the next best thing I
can think of without introducing a single lock for modifying the array entries.

If you have any other idea, please share.
