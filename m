Sorry for insisting - in your original submission "Revert "qla2xxx: Fix
Nport ID display value" from 11/09/2019, you'd identified this as a
regression caused by 0aabb6b699f7 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix Nport ID display
value"). Are you saying that that wasn't the whole truth? Had N2N been
broken before already? Did N2N with "old" adapters ever work with
previous versions of the driver? Which ones?

@Himanshu, Quinn, can you say anything about this subject? Do you
intend to work on fixing this any time soon?

Martin
