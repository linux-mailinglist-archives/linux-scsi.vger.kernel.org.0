You mean for performance reasons.  That is something we can
look at, but let's get it working first.

I am hoping that was the problem that Rafael's revert dealt with.

If sd 0:0:0:x is active then rpm_get_suppliers() still has +1 rpm_active. pm_runtime_get_suppliers() also has +1 rpm_active.
i.e. rpm_active is 3. If rpm_put_suppliers() is called, it means sd 0:0:0:x has really runtime suspended (not just waiting for autosuspend.  Otherwise when the probe ends pm_runtime_put_suppliers() will drop rpm_active from 3 to 2.

But it is a bit theoretical.  Let's try it and see.

I really think it would be good to try the changes that have been identified and see how it behaves.

Then go from there.
