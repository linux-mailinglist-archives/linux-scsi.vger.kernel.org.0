Hi John,

As I clarified at lunch today, your "DMMP is currently the only
upstream component which continues to use the Request interface for
submitting IO." makes no sense to me.  The request-based DM multipath
target is a blk-mq driver.  It just acts like most blk-mq drivers.

What is different is DM core's request-based code will clone each
request that gets submitted to the request-based DMMP device.  And
then when the request is submitted to an underlying path it gets
directly inserted in the unlering blk-mq request-queue for that path.

So in those aspects request-based DM core and DM multipath are unique
and they do require block interfaces that only benefit DMMP -- but
that has _always_ been the case (nothing else ever needed to clone
requests before submitting them).

Other useful context is the 2007 paper that provides an overview of
why dm-multipath was switched from bio-based to request-based:
