But restarting the READ of one "logical block" at LBA 0 when the kernel
thought that was 4096 bytes and the drive returned 512 bytes is exactly
what I observed; again and again.

IMO the kernel should be prepared for surprises when reading LBA 0,
such as:
   - the block size is not what it was expecting [as in this case]
   - that block has never been written and the disk has been told to
     return an (IO) error in that case

It is a pity that a SCSI pass-through like the bsg or sg driver cannot
establish its own I_T nexus, separate from the I_T nexus that the
sd driver uses. The reason is that if an I_T nexus causes a UA (e.g.
MODE SELECT change LB size) then the next command (apart from
INQUIRY, REPORT LUNS and friends) will _not_ receive that UA. [Other
I_T nexi will receive that UA.]

SCSI data-out and data-in transfers are inherently unaligned (or byte
aligned) but I suppose the DMA silicon in the HBA may have some
alignment requirements.
