It is a regression because it breaks user space.

First, I want to emphasise that your patch was correctly fixing the =
problem it was supposed
to fix. And I acked it. The problems after boot were far-fetched and not =
easy to see. This
happens.

My mild complaint is that there were no reports on linux-scsi about the =
problems after
boot. Someone might have seen these problems earlier if there were those =
reports.
(With hindsight, Rafal Rocha's patch dealt with this problem.)

But now we know where the problem is. Let'f concentrate on fixing it.

Obviously, one problem here is that our tape tests here at RH (and =
everywhere) are inadequate - at least w.r.t. resets. I'm working to =
improve this.

I was experimenting with different things using (slightly enhanced) =
csi_debug and scripts
using snippets from your testing scripts. When I set scsi_level to 6 in =
scsi_debug, I noticed
that after modprobe, stinit and also dd failed. This lead me to think =
that this was because
now st caught the initial POR UA. The distribution I used for testing =
also had an udev rule
to run stinit when a drive was detected. The current stinit does return =
0 also when setting
options fails, but I could see that the options did not get set.

You should see these things with a real tape drive, too.

...
> I really don't want to revert commit 9604eea5bd3ae1. It actually fixes =
a real problem where the tape drive behind a gateway device crashes and =
resets itself.  Then, because the st driver ignores the POR/UA, it =
writes a file mark at the BOT.  This destroys the customer's backup.  It =
is a serious problem and a day-one bug.

I agree that the patch is useful. That is why it is better to fix the =
negative consequencies.

Yes. But I don't think pos_unknown should be set for the initial POR UA. =
 I think it
is reasonable to assume that the user does not trust knowing the tape =
location
right after the device is added.

I sent the patch ([PATCH] scsi: st: Regression fix: Don't set =
pos_unknown just after device recognition) to linux-scsi on
Dec 16.
