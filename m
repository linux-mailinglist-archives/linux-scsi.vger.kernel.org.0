Actually, it's not quite that easy, we filter out this ASC/ASCQ
combination from the check because we should never ignore medium might
have changed events on running devices.  We could ignore it if we had a
flag to say the power has been yanked (perhaps an additional sdev flag
you set on resume) but we would still miss the case where you really
had powered off the drive and then changed the media ... if you can
regard this as the user's problem, then we might have a solution.
