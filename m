We are talking about removing support for BT-445S with firmware version
older than 3.37. That is a very specific case. To continue support for
this very specific case, we have to add new code to use local bounce
buffer and we have no hardware to verify this new code. This will be new
code whether we add it now or later after we find someone even has this
very old card with old firmware. I would prefer to remove support for
now and add new code to add support for firmware version older than 3.37
back only if there is a need later. For now anyone who is using a
BT-445S and has updated firmware on their card will not see a change.
