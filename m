The article you cited does not refute what I said about prioritized 
interrupts.

The article is about eliminating the distinction between fast and slow 
interrupt handlers.

The article says that some developers convinced Linus that, although 
minimal interrupt latency is desirable, is isn't strictly necessary.

The article also warns of stack overflow from arbitrarily deep slow 
interrupt nesting, but that's not what m68k does.

I'm not going to guess whether other platforms might be affected -- you're 
supporting this patch so you will have to show that it is correct.

Interrupt handlers on m68k do not enable interrupts. If they did, you 
would see that warning fire. It doesn't fire. Try it.
