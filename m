I had similar thought comparing SCSI command scheduling with process scheduling
real-time scheduling can cause starvation when newer requests are postponed indefinitely,
while the classic scheduler increases the chance of longer-waiting tasks to be scheduled next.
In any case that would require some sorting of the queue (or searching for a maximum/minimum in the requests which is equivalent).
