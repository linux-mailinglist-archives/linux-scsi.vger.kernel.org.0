I think this is good topic and I would like to participate in the
discussion too. I think that Logan Gunthorpe would also be interested
(Cc). Adding Kanchan too, who is also working on this and can contribute
to the discussion

We discussed this in the context of P2P at different SNIA events in the
context of computational offloads and also as the backend implementation
for Simple Copy, which is coming in NVMe. Discussing this (again) at
LSF/MM and finding a way to finally get XCOPY merged would be great.

Thanks,
Javier
