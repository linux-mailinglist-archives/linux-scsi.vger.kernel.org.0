AFAIU, Prior to these proposed changes in scm, HWKM was done with help 
of TA(Trusted Application) for generate, import, unwrap ... functionality.

1. What is the reason for moving this from TA to new smc calls?

Is this because of missing smckinvoke support in upstream?

How scalable is this approach? Are we going to add new sec sys calls to 
every interface to TA?

2. How are the older SoCs going to deal with this, given that you are 
changing drivers that are common across these?

Have you tested these patches on any older platforms?

What happens if someone want to add support to wrapped keys to this 
platforms in upstream, How is that going to be handled?

As I understand with this, we will endup with two possible solutions 
over time in upstream.
