So far, it means that handling interrupt & softirq takes all utilization
of one CPU, then processes can't be run on this CPU basically, usually
sort of CPU lockup warning will be triggered.

The solution is to switch to handle this interrupt on the created rescue
irq thread context when irq flood is detected, and 'this interrupt' means
the interrupt requested with IRQF_RESCUE_THREAD.

The solution tracks the time taken on running do_IRQ() for each CPU.
