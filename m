May be it contribute to some extent, but I do not think streaming
applications have any incentive/reason to give small IO. An
application like Netflix need to read as much data as soon as possible
and serve to customers, they have no reason to read in small chunks.
In fact, they read in huge chunks.
That is why sequential IO is normally large chunks and random IO (
which is more DB kind of operations ) is small IO.
Only exception I know of is database REDO logs, that are small
sequential IO, because there the DB is logging small transactions --
but they go to SSDs.

No, I got the idea, I am just saying most high end controllers have an
IO size limit  , and even if the block layer merges IO, it does not
help, since they have to be broken to the max size the controller
supports. Also, most high end controllers have their own merging
logic, and hence not too much dependent on upper layer merging for
them
