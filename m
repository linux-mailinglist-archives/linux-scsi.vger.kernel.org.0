No, let's not complicate it without good reason. SDM845 has hw_ver.major
== 3, so we're not taking the else-path in ufs_qcom_init(). So I should
be able to just merge this patch for 5.9 through the qcom tree after
all (your code handles that it's not there and the existing code doesn't
care).


The two platforms that I can find that has UFS controller of
hw_ver.major == 1 is APQ8084 and MSM8994, so I simply didn't look at an
old enough downstream tree (msm-3.10) to find anyone specifying reg[1].
The reg specified is however coming from the TLMM (pinctrl-msm) hardware
block, so it should not be directly remapped in the UFS driver...

But regardless, that has not been seen in an upstream dts and per your
patch 2 we would add that reg by name when that happens.
There's recent activity on upstreaming more of the MSM8994 support, so
perhaps then it's best to leave this snippet in the driver for now.


Summary: Martin merges (merged?) patch 1, 2, 4 and 5 in the scsi tree,
I'll merge this patch as is in the qcom tree and we'll just leave the
dev_ref_clk handling as is for now then.

Bjorn
