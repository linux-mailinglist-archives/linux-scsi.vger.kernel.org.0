I see what you are saying. See below.

Ah yeah, that is bogus. I am still working on an issue in this code. I =
wasn=E2=80=99t expecting a line by line and just a general review of =
cfgfs vs sysfs :) Sorry about that.

I originally made it so when we make the tpg and before it is enabled =
you had to do mkdir sessions on the tpg to signal the kernel that the =
app supports the new interface. The kernel would then make the acl =
sessions dir for you.

I was tracking down a bug in that though, and for the posting I made it =
so userspace had to create the acl sessions dir. While cutting and =
pasting the code I forgot to fix up that code.

It=E2=80=99s just a lot easier to leave it set if userspace has enabled =
it once. You actually need to take into account if the tpg is enabled, =
and then you have some issues with the drivers that have their own nexus =
interface, and then there are different userspace code paths that handle =
this.

I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s going to be common to mix and match =
updated and non-updated tools, so once its set, it=E2=80=99s set. If you =
disagree let me know. It can be done.
