Yeah, but it's not all good - there would still be a certain overhead in 
the atomic set and unset bit on the hctx sbitmap. However it still 
should be faster as it excludes the search.

Right

Eh, I hope that we wouldn't need this.

Right, but don't we need to then "kick all hw queues", instead of just 
that for the current hctx in blk_mq_get_tag() when free tags are exhausted?

Yeah, to me it seems sensible. Again, a neat implementation is the 
challenge.

I'll post an RFC v2 for this one.

I am also requesting some performance figures also internally.

Thanks,
