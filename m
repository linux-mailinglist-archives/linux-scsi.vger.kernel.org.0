There is an attempt in 2021 todo exactly same thing I guess,

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-fscrypt/cover/20211206225725.77512-1-quic_gaurkash@quicinc.com/

If this was the right thing to do they why is the TZ firmware on SoCs 
after 2021 not having support for this ?

So how does Andriod kernel upgrades work after applying this patchset on 
platforms like SM8550 or SM8450 or SM8250..or any old platforms.

If we have an smcinvoke tee driver we can talk to to this TA.

I can see that.

Am not against adding this new interface, but is this new interface 
leaving a gap for older platforms?


Is there any other technical reason for moving out from TA based to a 
smc calls?

And are we doing a quick solution here to fix something

AFAIU, There are other downstream Qualcomm LE platforms that use wrapped 
key support with the older interface.
What happens to them whey then upgrade the kernel?

Does TA interface still continue to work with the changes that went into 
common drivers (ufs/sd)?
