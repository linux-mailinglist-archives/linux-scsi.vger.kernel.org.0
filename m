Do you have other info, like IRQ-CPU affinity dump and controller PCI 
vendor+device ID? Also /proc/interrupts info would be good after a run, 
like supplied by Sumit here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/CAL2rwxotoWakFS4DPe85hZ4VAgd_zw8pL+B5ckHR9NwEf+-L=g@mail.gmail.com/

Are you enabling some special driver perf mode?

In theory, from this driver perspective, we should not be making a 
difference. That's after your change to use sdev-> device busy count, 
rather than the hctx nr_active count. As I understand, that's the only 
difference you made.

But I will try an IO scheduler on hisi sas for ssd to see if any difference.

Hopefully you can use nr_hw_queues = N always.
