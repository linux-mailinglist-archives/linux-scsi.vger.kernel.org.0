My idea here was that that 'marginal' port state is initiated by FPIN 
notifications; ideally set from the driver itself, but initially most 
likely from userspace (eg multipathd).

Problem here is that the FPIN comes in various flavours (eg congestion 
or link degradation), each of which will result in either one or several 
FPIN notifications.
EG for link congestion it is expected to get messages at a certain 
frequency for as long as the situation occurs.
Meaning we would have to have some sort of mechanism for checking that 
frequency, and reset the state if the condition persists.

How exactly we're going to do this, whether by external daemon or 
integrated into multipathd, is currently subject for debate and testing.
I would prefer to have it integrated into multipathd, but it might well 
become too complex such that an external daemon might be the better option.

Cheers,

Hannes
