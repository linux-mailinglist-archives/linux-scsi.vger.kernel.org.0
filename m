Hi

There is an issue with the SCSI UFS driver when the optional
BOOT well-known LUN fails to probe, which is not a fatal error.
The issue is that the device and its "managed" device link do not
then get deleted.  The device because the device link has a
reference to it.  The device link because it can only be deleted
by device_del(), but device_add() was never called, so device_del()
never will be either.

These V2 patches fix the issue by amending device link removal to accept
removal of a link with an unregistered consumer device, as suggested
by Rafael.


Changes in V2:

	Take approach suggested by Rafael
