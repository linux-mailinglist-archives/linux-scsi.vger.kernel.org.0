Hi,
Addressing this issue first (i.e. loading things in scsi_debug_init() ). The
bulk of the work is done in that function's final for loop. Would putting
that in its own thread started by a workqueue help? If so, then
scsi_debug_init() could complete reasonably quickly. That thread
(called sdeb_add_hosts_thr, say) might still be running when a rmmod is
attempted. How to handle that?

For some other testing, I was loading up 10,000 scsi_debug LUNs and found t=
hat
life was too short for ptype=3D0 (i.e. disks (and the default). When I set
ptype=3D21 (Reserved according to T10) things went impressively quickly. By
randomly killing threads, I suspect udev daemons are (a large) part of the
cause.

In the hack proposed above, not much would appear in sysfs until that thread
finished adding at least adding its first host by which time scsi_debug_ini=
t()
should have long since finished.

I'm looking for some callback that scsi_debug wires up in its init function
that when called will try and stop things, or at least stop adding new thin=
gs.

Backward compatibility :-)

You asked how it works, try:
     modprobe scsi_debug tur_ms_to_ready=3D20000
