Actually, it's been around almost as long as ftrace. But unfortunately,
it's just now becoming a separate library. It was originally developed for
trace-cmd, but has been copied into perf, power-top and rasdaemon. But this
copying is inefficient and a maintenance nightmare, and we finally have the
library as a stand alone, and hopefully will be delivered by distributions
(I believe they are packaging it).

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libtrace/libtraceevent.git/

Looks like distros are starting to catch on.

  https://packages.debian.org/unstable/libtraceevent-dev


We are currently working on libtracefs

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libtrace/libtracefs.git/

Which will make it a lot easier for applications to interact with the
tracefs file system. I'm hoping to have this ready for distros by the end
of the year. We have applications coming that depend on these.

I think libtraceevent and libtracefs would be a much welcome addition for
upiu trace as it would be reading raw data (very fast), and have an API
that makes doing so much simpler. For example, I just wrote a quick program
that checks what files an application opens (this is not in anyway
production ready):

Of course!

And again, I would be happy to help out in converting to this libraries. It
will make your applications more robust, as they make it so that you do not
need to rely on the order of fields.

Note, there's plans on making these libraries python modules as well (to
have python scripts enable and read ftrace data).
