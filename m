These patches are based on Martin Petersen's 6.12/scsi-queue tree
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mkp/scsi.git
  6.12/scsi-queue

There are two functional changes:
    smartpqi-add-fw-log-to-kdump
    smartpqi-add-counter-for-parity-write-stream-requests

There are three minor bug fixes:
    smartpqi-fix-stream-detection
    smartpqi-fix-rare-system-hang-during-LUN-reset
    smartpqi-fix-volume-size-updates

The other two patches add PCI-IDs for new controllers and change the
driver version.

This set of changes consists of:
* smartpqi-add-fw-log-to-kdump

  During a kdump, the driver tells the controller to copy its logging information to some
  pre-allocated buffers that can be analyzed later.

  This is a "feature" driven capability and is backward compatible with existing controller FW.

  This patch renames some prefixes for OFA (Online-Firmware Activation ofa_*) buffers
  to host_memory_*. So, not a lot of actual functional changes to smartpqi_init.c,
  mainly determining the memory size allocation.

  We added a function to notify the controller to copy debug data into host memory before
  continuing kdump.

  Most of the functional changes are in smartpqi_sis.c where the actual handshaking is done.

* smartpqi-fix-stream-detection

  Correct some false write-stream detections. The data structure used to check for write-streams
  was not initialized to all 0's causing some false write stream detections. The driver sends
  down streamed requests to the raid engine instead of using AIO bypass for some extra performance.
  (Potential full-stripe write verses Read Modify Write).

  False detections have not caused any data corruption.
  Found by internal testing. No known externally reported bugs.

* smartpqi-add-counter-for-parity-write-stream-requests

  Adding some counters for raid_bypass and write streams. These two counters are related
  because write stream detection is only checked if an I/O request is eligible for bypass (AIO).

  The bypass counter (raid_bypass_cnt) was moved into a common structure (pqi_raid_io_stats) and
  changed to type __percpu. The write stream counter is (write_stream_cnt) has been added to
  this same structure.

  These counters are __percpu counters for performance. We added a sysfs entry to show the
  write stream count. The raid bypass counter sysfs entry already exists.

  Useful for checking streaming writes. The change in the sysfs entry write_stream_cnt can be
  checked during AIO eligible write operations.

* smartpqi-add-new-controller-PCI-IDs

  Adding support for new controller HW.
  No functional changes.

* smartpqi-fix-rare-system-hang-during-LUN-reset

  We found a rare race condition that can occur during a LUN reset. We were not emptying
  our internal queue completely.

  There have been some rare conditions where our internal request queue has requests for
  multiple LUNs and a reset comes in for one of the LUNs. The driver waits for this internal
  queue to empty. We were only clearing out the requests for the LUN being reset so the
  request queue was never empty causing a hang.

  The Fix:
     For all requests in our internal request queue:
        Complete requests with DID_RESET for queued requests for the device undergoing a reset.
        Complete requests with DID_REQUEUE for all other queued requests.

  Found by internal testing. No known externally reported bugs.

* smartpqi-fix-volume-size-updates

  The current code only checks for a size change if there is also a queue depth change.
  We are separating the check for queue depth and the size changes.

  Found by internal testing. No known bugs were filed.

* smartpqi-update-version-to-2.1.30-031
  No functional changes.
