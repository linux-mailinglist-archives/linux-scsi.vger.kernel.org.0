It could only take a few CPU cycles. So there is little benefit for 
speeding up interrupt processing.You could take them as cleanup.

Is removing this cost worth the risk of introducing subtle

Currently, only found M68K platform support that high-priority interrupt 
preempts low-priority. No other platform has such services. Therefore, 
these changes do not affect non-M68K platforms.

For M68K platform, no one report such interrupt preemption case in these 
SCSI drivers.

Actually, no.
