Hi Roman,

I'm not sure adding a new kernel switch is the best choice. That would
be an additional parameter users have to know about and have to learn
how to use.

Bodo seems to be in favor of this patch series. Are there other people
who want to share their opinion about this patch series?

Thanks,

Bart.
