You mentioned you need realtime so you want an interrupt to be able to
preempt another one. Now you said you want an interrupt not to be preempted
as it will make a timing issue. If this PDMA transfer will have some problem
when it is preempted, I believe we need some enhanced ways to handle this,
otherwise, once we enable preempt_rt or threaded_irq, it will get the timing
issue. so here it needs a clear comment and IRQF_NO_THREAD if this is the
case.

Nope.

I would say the real misguidance is that the code adds one lock while it
doesn't need the lock. Easily we can add redundant locks or exaggerate
the coverage range of locks, but the smarter way is that people add
locks only when they really need the lock by considering concurrency and
realtime performance.
