Yes, I did, but I already explained that they are irrelevant.  If I ask
you to buy me something, asking an extra question and saying "you might
want to ask XYZ instead" would make me happier than "you might want to
buy that on Amazon or ask someone else I can't remember off the top of
my head".  Perhaps I needed icecream that Amazon doesn't even sell. :)

I do apologize for being too blunt, but here are the reasons you brought up:

- "I'm not sure it makes sense to introduce custom IDs for these given
that there already are unique per-host cgroup IDs which aren't recycled"
(VM IDs are recycled, that's the idea, so I don't think this applies?)

- "There are basic problems with e.g. delegation as these things are at
odds with everything else sharing the interface" (this I cannot parse at
all: what is delegation, who is the everything else that's sharing the
interface?  why would the problem not be there if you put the interface
somewhere in the SCSI layer?)

- "people who don't need app_identifier don't see them and preferably
can disable them" (ok this I get, but then the same applies to a lot of
stuff in sysfs).

- "the proposed is akin to adding per-thread application ID to procfs
[...] which wouldn't fly well either given the specialized and (at least
for now) niche nature of the feature" (so it is basically that it is too
specialized; cache allocation technology comes to mind then, it is also
very specialized but we _did_ add resctrl hooks into procfs).


My feeling (it's a feeling---it doesn't have to be that way!) was that
you didn't try too hard to understand the problem and to help the
submitter reframe it.  As you said very properly, apologies if I'm
misunderstanding you, but I would like to be clear about what I perceived.

Thanks,

Paolo
