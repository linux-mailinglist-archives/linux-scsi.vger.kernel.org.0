Ah, OK.  I think for these arrays you'd be better off accepting the cost
of an extra 4 bytes in the struct scsi_device rather than the cost of
storing the scsi_device at the LUN.

Let's just work an example where you have a 64-bit LUN with 4 ranges,
each of 64 entries (this is almost a best-case scenario for the XArray).
[0,63], 2^62+[0,63], 2^63+[0,63], 2^63+2^62+[0,63].

If we store them sequentially in an allocating XArray, we take up 256 *
4 bytes = 1kB extra space in the scsi_device.  The XArray will allocate
four nodes plus one node to hold the four nodes, which is 5 * 576 bytes
(2780 bytes) for a total of 3804 bytes.

Storing them in at their LUN will allocate a top level node which covers
bits 60-66, then four nodes, each covering bits of 54-59, another four
nodes covering bits 48-53, four nodes for 42-47, ...  I make it 41 nodes,
coming to 23616 bytes.  And the pointer chase to get to each LUN is
ten deep.  It'll mostly be cached, but still ...

It certainly seems sensible to me to have a per-host allocating XArray
to store the targets that belong to that host.  I imagine you also want
a per-target XArray for the LUNs that belong to that target.  Do you
also want a per-host XArray to store the LUNs so you can iterate all
LUNs per host as a single lookup rather than indirecting through the
target Xarray?  That's a design decision for you to make.
