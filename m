Please take a look at the bsg_setup_queue() call in ufs_bsg_probe(). 
That call associates a BSG queue with the UFS host. That queue supports 
requests of type struct ufs_bsg_request. The Fibre Channel transport 
driver does something similar. I believe that this is a better solution 
than introducing entirely new ioctls.

How about include/uapi/scsi/spraid.h, since I assume that that header 
file will cover all user space interfaces for interaction with the 
spraid driver?

Thanks,

Bart.
