I don't understand why people think it's acceptable to ask user space to
parse text that is subject to change.

We usually don't have the needed information if you remove the
expectation that user space should parse the human readable portion of
the error message.

We could have the information if all the storage paths went through
dev_printk.  Here is what we get today when we encounter a read error
which uses printk in the block layer:

{
        "_HOSTNAME" : "pn",
        "_TRANSPORT" : "kernel",
        "__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP" : "1806379233",
        "SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER" : "kernel",
        "_SOURCE_MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP" : "1805611354",
        "SYSLOG_FACILITY" : "0",
        "MESSAGE" : "blk_update_request: critical medium error, dev
nvme0n1, sector 10000 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 3 prio class 0",
        "PRIORITY" : "3",
        "_MACHINE_ID" : "3f31a0847cea4c95b7a9cec13d07deeb",
        "__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP" : "1601471260802301",
        "_BOOT_ID" : "b03ed610f21d46ab8243a495ba5a0058",
        "__CURSOR" :
"s=a063a22bbb384da0b0412e8f652deabb;i=23c2;b=b03ed610f21d46ab8243a495ba5a0058;m=6bab28e1;t=5b087959e3cfd;x=20528862f8f765c9"
}

Unless you parse the message text you cannot make the association.  If
the same message was changed to dev_printk we would get:


{
        "__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP" : "1589401901093443",
        "__CURSOR" :

                "/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-QEMU_NVMe_Ctrl_DEADBEEF"

Journald already knows how to utilize the dev_printk meta data.

One idea that I've suggested along the way is creating a dev_printk
function that doesn't change the message text.  We then avoid breaking
people that are parsing.  Is this something that would be acceptable to
folks?  It doesn't solve early boot where udev rules haven't even run,
but it's better.

Thanks,
Tony
