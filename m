I am sorry, I overlooked that part in sg.c where you set DRIVER_SENSE. 
It's the only DRIVER_xyz code that you set though. Is that sufficient? 

In bsg.c, I just see 

@@ -96,7 +96,7 @@ static int bsg_scsi_complete_rq(struct request *rq, struct sg_io_v4 *hdr)
         */
        hdr->device_status = sreq->result & 0xff;
        hdr->transport_status = host_byte(sreq->result);
-       hdr->driver_status = driver_byte(sreq->result);
+       hdr->driver_status = 0;
        hdr->info = 0;
        if (hdr->device_status || hdr->transport_status || hdr->driver_status)
                hdr->info |= SG_INFO_CHECK;
	hdr->driver_status = 0;

To me that looks as if userspace might get a different result as
before. Similar in bsg_lib.c. I may be overlooking something again, but
not being familiar with the bsg driver, I thought I'd better ask.

(Nitpick: your change obsoletes the check for hdr->driver_status two
lines below).

Thanks
Martin
