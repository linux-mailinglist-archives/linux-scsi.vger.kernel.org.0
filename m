And that was precisely the point of my patchset: do _not_ use driver 
byte nor message byte in the SCSI midlayer.
So the midlayer can be reduced to handling just the host byte and the 
status byte. Whether this is by means of a union or something else 
doesn't really matter; this patchset doesn't prevent any of this from 
happening.

I'm open to discussion on whether we need to expose the original driver 
byte to userspace; I've already attempted to do this for DRIVER_SENSE, 
and if needs be DRIVER_ERROR can be fudged in, too.
But I do think that message byte handling should be killed from the 
midlayer, as it really is SCSI parallel specific and shouldn't be 
exposed to the midlayer at all.

Cheers,

Hannes
