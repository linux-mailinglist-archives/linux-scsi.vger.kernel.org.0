The problem is that this patchset was sent out without the patches that add the
block and filesystem-level framework for hardware-wrapped inline encryption
keys, which it depends on.  So it's lacking context.  The proposed framework can
be found at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20231104211259.17448-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u

As for why "trusted keys" aren't used, they just aren't helpful here.  "Trusted
keys" are based around a model where the kernel can request that keys be sealed
and unsealed using a trust source, and the kernel gets access to the raw
unsealed keys.  Hardware-wrapped inline encryption keys use a different model
where the kernel never gets access to the raw keys.  They also have the concept
of ephemeral wrapping which does not exist in "trusted keys".  And they need to
be properly integrated with the inline encryption framework in the block layer.
