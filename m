Hi

There is an issue with the SCSI UFS driver when the optional
BOOT well-known LUN fails to probe, which is not a fatal error.
The issue is that the device and its "managed" device link do not
then get deleted.  The device because the device link has a
reference to it.  The device link because it can only be deleted
by device_del(), but device_add() was never called, so device_del()
never will be either.

It is not clear if there is a way to get rid of the device link in
this case, so here is a patch to add a function that does just that.

There is also a patch to use the new function to fix the issue with
the SCSI UFS driver.
