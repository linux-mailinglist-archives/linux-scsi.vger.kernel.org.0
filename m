Please consider this rewrite:

It is possible that the controller may become suspended between 
processing a phyup interrupt and the event being processed by libsas. As 
such, we can't ensure that the controller is active when processing the 
phyup event - this may cause the phyup event to be lost or other issues.
To avoid any possible issues, add pm_runtime_get_noresume() in the phyup 
interrupt handler and pm_runtime_put_sync() in the work handler exit to 
ensure that we stay always active. Since we only want 
pm_runtime_get_noresume() called for v3 hw, signal this will a new 
event, HISI_PHYE_PHY_UP_PM.

Thanks,
John
