Hibernation flow is:

	->freeze()
	create memory image
	->thaw()
	write image
	->poweroff()

	time passes
	someone presses the power button or something else activates the machine

	kernel boots
	detects restore image
	read image
	->freeze()
	restore memory image
	->restore()

It is up to ->restore() to ensure the device state matches the
memory state as it was when the hibernation image was made.
