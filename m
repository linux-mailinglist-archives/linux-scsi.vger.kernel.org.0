Kashyap,
I did post a fixing patch titled: "[PATCH] scsi_debug: add new defer_type
for mq_poll" and cc-ed it to you.

At first I also thought your scsi_debug patch worked but on closer
examination it was falling through to the existing
delay_expired-event_generated model. It was only when I checked for
requests with REQ_HIPRI set and in those cases turned off the event
generation, that I saw it was not working.

Another way to tell if iopoll/blk_poll is really working is to turn off
the code that drives blk_poll(). What should happen in that case (due to
the mid layer) is that the command timeout (after 60 seconds?) should
cancel the command. If the command still manages to succeed normally
then iopoll is not really working.

And on my side the most recent "[PATCH v15 00/45] sg: add v4 interface"
patchset [20210225] included "[PATCH v15 44/45] sg: add blk_poll support".
Jens accepted a patch to the fio sg engine to use the "hipri=1" option
to drive that new capability. This is an addition to the fio script
example that you sent using io_uring:

[global]
ioengine=io_uring
hipri=1
direct=1
runtime=3s
rw=randread
norandommap
bs=512

[seqprecon]
filename=/dev/sdb
