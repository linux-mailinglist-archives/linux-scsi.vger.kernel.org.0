In commit messages and comments, please spell out "Inline Crypto Engine (ICE)"
the first time it appears, so that people know what ICE means.

Since this is a library, it shouldn't be user-selectable, but rather just be
selected by the other options that need it.  Putting a string after "tristate"
makes it user-selectable; the string is the prompt string.  The line should just
be "tristate", without a string afterwards.

For log messages associated with a device, the dev_*() functions should be used
instead of pr_*().  How about including the relevant 'struct device *' in the
struct ice_mmio_data?

This comment applies to everywhere in qti-ice-common that is logging anything.

Be more specific about what "failure" means here.  It means that the driver
doesn't support the ICE hardware, right?  -ENODEV would be a more appropriate
error code for this.  -EINVAL is a very generic error.

This part changed slightly from the original code in
drivers/scsi/ufs/ufs-qcom-ice.c and drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-msm.c.  What is the
reason for these changes?  To be fair, I can't properly explain this part of the
original code; I just did what some existing ICE code was doing.  But if it
wasn't the correct or best way, it would be super useful to understand *why*
this different version is really the correct/best way.

Also note that the line "regval |= 0x7000;" is redundant.

The copy of this in drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-msm.c is a bit nicer in that it uses
the readl_poll_timeout() helper function, and it has a longer comment explaining
it.  So I think you should use that version rather than the UFS version.

How does TrustZone differentiate between raw and wrapped keys?  I thought you
had mentioned that only one is supported at a time on a particular SoC.

This is assuming that wrapped keys aren't longer than raw AES-256-XTS keys,
which isn't necessarily true.

Previously, writel() and readl() were used instead of writel_relaxed() and
readl_relaxed().  What is the reason for this change?  My understanding is that
the *_relaxed() functions are harder to use correctly, so they shouldn't be used
unless it's been carefully thought through and the extra performance is needed.
