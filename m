Hi Hannes,

JFYI, I have rebased this series to 5.6-rc4 here:

https://github.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/tree/private-topic-sas-5.6-resv-commands-v1

I am interested in enabling this for libsas and associated HBAs, so 
there are some patches on top for that.

No review comments have been addressed, apart from removing "block: 
disable elevator for reserved tags"

Please let me know your plan for this series.

Thanks,
John
