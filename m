Agree, ioctl(VHOST_RUN_WORKER) is interesting and perhaps simplifies 
thread management (pinning, etc.), but with kthread would be easier to 
implement polling sharing worker with multiple devices.

Thanks, Mike please can you keep me in CC for this work?

It's really interesting since I'll have similar issues to solve with 
vDPA software device.

Thanks,
