I agree.

I do not think the kernel should use the limit from one userspace
application. What if you are using a different app or what happens when
someone updates targetcli. You do not want to have to update the kernel
each time. I think the driver should report what it is limited to.

The targetcli limit might be due to how it allocates the LUN,
probes/scans configfs, etc. I think in some places you could end up doing

for i <  U64_MAX
    do some inefficient configfs probe/scan

so for targetcli a value less than U64_MAX makes sense so some commands
do not take minutes. Other apps might work differently though.
