Yeah, but the patch records the jiffies before calling
blk_mq_wait_quiesce_done, and only time out requests which are timed out
before the recorded time, so it is fine to use blk_mq_wait_quiesce_done
in this way.

No, the stall just happens on one vCPU, and other vCPUs may run smoothly.

1) vmexit, which only stalls one vCPU, some vmexit could come anytime,
such as external interrupt

2) vCPU is emulated by pthread usually, and the pthread is just one
normal host userspace pthread, which can be preempted anytime, and
the preempt latency could be long enough when the system load is
heavy.

And it is like random stall added when running any instruction of
VM kernel code.

The thing is that it is one generic issue, lots of VM drivers could be
affected, and it may not be easy for drivers to handle the race too.



Thanks,
