Then fix that and everything shows up automatically "for free".

file systems are not devices with busses and drivers :)

Don't do it.

Again, a "deep tree" with raw kobjects will be invisible to the normal
userspace tools that monitor changes in sysfs for devices because they
will not notice them at all.

There should not be any difference in "speed" for something like that,
it's an in-ram filesystem with no i/o times.

Nope :(
