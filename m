Interesting. All others do care about the state of the rport, as for
them sending commands to a blocked rport will just cause
the TMF to fail.

Yes, but that is perfectly fine, and in fact exactly as things should
work. Once a device is in SDEV_TRANSPORT_OFFLINE it means that the
underlying rport has been deleted after dev_loss_tmo has expired.
If that happened during SCSI EH, well, tough luck. I/O would have
been aborted even without SCSI EH here.
All fine by me.

Thanks a lot. Modification to zfcp have been bogging me down for quite some
while, glad that we've found this rather easy solution.

Will be sending an updated version.
