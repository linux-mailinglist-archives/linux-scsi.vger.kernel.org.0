Hi James

I very well know the book. But the chapter on block devices is
targeted at, what I believe, are called 'target devices' in the
overall topology, isn't it? I am specifically looking at drivers for
HBAs, the host bus adapters. As you said, it is highly manufacturer
dependent, which is why perhaps there isn't a generic guide to it.

But I am looking at understanding the broader concepts associated with
writing HBA drivers. As far as I understand up until now, they talk
"scsi" to the target device (or its firmware to be more specific", who
then translates the scsi commands into actions to be taken on the
actual blocks (LBA/CHS). Am I right? So I believe I need some
familiarity with the SCSI "command set" as it is. Could you shed some
light on this?
