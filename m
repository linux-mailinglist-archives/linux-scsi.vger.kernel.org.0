I agree. No problem there. Our array could and does return transitioning =
on
some portal groups while others might be active/online or unavailable.

I am not saying that all paths should be changed to transitioning, but
I/Os sent to the path that is in transitioning should not immediately
fail if there is not an online path like what does happen without
this patch or one like it.

The other paths which are in other states should succeed or fail
I/O as they would based on their state. I am only concerned about
the portal group in the transitioning state and making sure it doesn=E2=80=
=99t
immediately bubble errors back to the multipath layer which fails the
path which is what we see and don=E2=80=99t want to see.

> So what is the error you are seeing?

Right now this is what fails and used to work before the patch
This worked in previous Linux versions and continues to work
in Windows, ESXi, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX. I have tested those.
It might work on others as well, but that list is good enough for me.

We have an array with two controllers and when all is good
each controller reports active/optimized for all of it ports. There
Is a TPG per controller.

CT0 - Primary - AO - TPG 0
CT1 - Secondary - AO - TPG 1

In any upgrade there is a point where we have to have the
secondary promote to primary. In our world we call this a
giveback. This is done by returning unavailable for I/O
that is sent to the previous primary CT0 and transitioning
for CT1, the promoting secondary:

CT0 - was primary - unavailable - TPG 0
CT1 - promoting not yet primary - transitioning - TPG 1

This is where we hit the issue. The paths to CT0 fail
since its ALUA state is unavailable as expected. The paths
to CT1 also quickly fail in the same second after some
retries. There are no paths which can serve I/O for a
short time as the secondary promotes to primary. We
expect ALUA state transitioning to protect this path
against an I/O error returning to multipath which it
no longer does.

If it worked we would expect:
CT0 - becoming secondary - still unavailable - TPG 0
CT1 - Primary - AO - TPG 1

And a short time later:
CT0 - secondary - AO - TPG 0
CT1 - primary - AO - TPG 1

Hopefully that helps with the context and why we
are proposing what we are.

Thanks,
Brian
