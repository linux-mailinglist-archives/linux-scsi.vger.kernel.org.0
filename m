Yes, that is one possible solution.

I was responding to a comment about detecting the device version and 
change the voltage
based on the detection. It is not implemented in this patch. Maybe I 
should stop
discussing another possible solution, even though related to the topic, 
it is not
implemented in this patch.

The initial voltage would be 2.9V and is lowered to 2.5V if UFS3.0+ 
device is detected.
We would call the regulator_set_voltage() to set to a specific voltage 
level.
