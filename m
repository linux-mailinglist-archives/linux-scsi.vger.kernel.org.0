Hi Bart,

I don't mind doing that, but is there any requirement for can_queue to 
not be limited to 16b?

It seems intentional that can_queue is int and cmd_per_lun is short.

As an aside, if short is 16b, it does not even seem to have efficient 
packing on Scsi_host today (although we can move things around):

int can_queue;
short cmd_per_lun;
short unsigned int sg_tablesize;
short unsigned int sg_prot_tablesize;
/* 16b hole */
unsigned int max_sectors;
