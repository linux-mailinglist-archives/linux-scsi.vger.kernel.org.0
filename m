Because it wouldn't be backwards compatible and something might break.
Under SCSI-1, devices were allowed to set this bit to signal vendor
unique status and a lot of manufacturers continued doing this for SCSI-
2, even though it was flagged as reserved instead of vendor specific in
that standard, hence the mask.  Since this was over 20 years ago, it is
possible there is no remaining functional device that does this, but if
it's not causing a problem, why take the risk?
