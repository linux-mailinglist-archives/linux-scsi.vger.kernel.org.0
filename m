It shouldn't: several transport classes, like SAS and FC have
intermediate devices between the host and the target and they all work
just fine using the non-host parent.  Since you don't give the error
this is just guesswork, but the host has to be somewhere in the parent
chain otherwise dev_to_shost(parent) will return NULL ... is that your
problem?

Best guess would be it wasn't converted over when the target list was
introduced.
