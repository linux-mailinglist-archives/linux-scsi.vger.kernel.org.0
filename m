I was doing some more testing of this since it has been a while since I=20=

ran these tests. It looks like reverting this will make the particular =
situation
that I am worried about even worse. I will put the detail in.

With this in place (before you revert it). When SCSI devices are =
discovered
and some have a PQ=3D1 because they are in an unavailable ALUA state:

Jan 27 12:05:29 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:0:1: scsi scan: peripheral =
device type of 31, no device added

I don=E2=80=99t know if this intentional with the patch or not but any =
devices with PQ=3D1
will not create SCSI devices. The logging is deceptive too since the =
device type
Is 0 and not 31. In my case I have two paths to LUN 1. One is ALUA AO =
and the=20
other in ALUA unavailable.

With this patch in I only get an sd device and an sg device for the AO =
path.=20
The other path to LUN 1 gets no devices created because it is caught in =
the
If condition logged above.

Because there are no SCSI devices created, when the ALUA state returns
to an active state, a SCSI rescan, which I can trigger from the target =
will result
in the devices getting created since the initial scan never created =
devices.

Jan 27 12:26:04 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:0:1: scsi scan: INQUIRY pass =
1 length 36
Jan 27 12:26:04 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:0:1: scsi scan: INQUIRY =
successful with code 0x0
Jan 27 12:26:04 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:0:1: scsi scan: INQUIRY pass =
2 length 96
Jan 27 12:26:04 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:0:1: scsi scan: INQUIRY =
successful with code 0x0
Jan 27 12:26:04 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:0:1: Direct-Access     PURE   =
  FlashArray       8888 PQ: 0 ANSI: 6

Things are good with both paths to LUN 1 showing up. It is not optimal =
since the
target has to trigger a LUN scan on the initiator affecting all paths to =
those target
ports.

With the revert of this, things are a little different, but the way they =
had been in
the past.

Jan 27 13:41:19 localhost kernel: sd 7:0:1:1: Asymmetric access state =
changed
Jan 27 13:41:56 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:1:1: alua: Detached

Jan 27 13:42:22 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:1:1: scsi scan: INQUIRY =
successful with code 0x0
Jan 27 13:42:22 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:1:1: Direct-Access     PURE   =
  FlashArray       8888 PQ: 1 ANSI: 6
Jan 27 13:42:22 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:1:1: alua: supports implicit =
TPGS
Jan 27 13:42:22 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:1:1: alua: device =
naa.624a9370acc31b042de141460001141c port group 0 rel port a
Jan 27 13:42:22 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:1:1: Attached scsi generic =
sg7 type 0

Now an sg device is created but not an sd device. This means that there =
will be
no way for this device to get an sd device created once the ALUA state =
goes into
an active state.

The same thing done on the target that worked above no longer does:

Jan 27 13:47:48 localhost kernel: scsi 7:0:1:1: scsi scan: device exists =
on 7:0:1:1

To get around this, the existing disk must be deleted so it is not =
caught in the rescan
check. This cannot be controlled on the target, but it will require =
manual intervention
on the initiator.

So the question becomes how should initial scan work when a LUN has a =
PQ=3D1 set.
It is a valid, by spec with ALUA state unavailable but doesn=E2=80=99t =
seem to be
handled. Why allow an sg device but not an sd one on initial scan in =
this case? There
are probably many ways to fix this. I think the simplest is to allow sd =
device creation
on LUNs were PQ=3D1, and only restrict PQ=3D3. I am not sure the side =
effect of this on other
targets. The other approach which will no longer work after the revert =
is to trigger a
rescan from the target. This is sub-optimal since it is disruptive. Any =
approach involving
the ALUA device handler will not help since there is no device to =
transition if it is
discovered with PQ=3D1.

Thanks,
Brian
