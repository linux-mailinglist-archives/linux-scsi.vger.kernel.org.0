Hello All,

There seems to be an incompatibility in the Linux SCSI code between SCSI =
disk
discovery and the ALUA state unavailable. =46rom the SPC specification =
if you use
ALUA state unavailable you also set the peripheral qualifier for that =
path.

While in the unavailable primary target port asymmetric access state, =
the device
server shall support those of the following commands that it supports =
while in the=20
active/optimized state:
a) INQUIRY (the peripheral qualifier (see 6.6.2) shall be set to 001b)
...

The problem with that is that it limits when the host can discover disks =
or reboot.
In order for an sd device to be created, the PQ must be 0. This seems to =
come from the
scsi_bus_match function in scsi_sysfs.c.

return (sdp->inq_periph_qual =3D=3D SCSI_INQ_PQ_CON)? 1: 0;

So it only will return 1, if the PQ is 0.=20

As a result if a SCSI device is discovered while the ALUA state for that =
path is
in the unavailable state, an sd device will not be created. An sg device =
will but
not an sd one. As a result multipath will not create a dm device. Or, if =
an existing
dm device exists, a path for this newly discovered device will not be =
created. This
means when the device moves out of unavailable to an active ALUA state, =
or even
standby, there is no device, so no path to change the state of in =
multipath's dm
device.

For this reason the ALUA state standby looks attractive since it doesn't =
have
the PQ requirement. But looking at the commands required for support in =
the standby
ALUA state, there are some that are difficult to support in the =
disconnected peer
state, most notably persistent reservations, where not having access to =
a peer
can result in an inability to keep a consistent state when and if the =
path again
becomes available. The unavailable ALUA state has the right command list =
to support
in being disconnected from the source of truth, but the PQ requirement =
is the
trade off.

Is the PQ check here because of INQUIRY requests sent to non-existent =
LUNs leading
to sd devices being created?

In response to an INQUIRY command received by an incorrect logical unit, =
the SCSI
target device shall return the INQUIRY data with the peripheral =
qualifier set to the
value defined in 6.6.2.

As a test, I changed this line to this to allow sd to create devices =
where the
peripheral qualifier is not 011b as opposed to needing to be 000b.

return (sdp->inq_periph_qual !=3D SCSI_INQ_PQ_NOT_CAP)? 1: 0;

This does allow an sd device to be created and multipath to create a =
path for it
in a dm device.

3624a93706a10c27f300a496100011010 dm-2 PURE    ,FlashArray     =20
size=3D2.0T features=3D'0' hwhandler=3D'1 alua' wp=3Drw
`-+- policy=3D'service-time 0' prio=3D0 status=3Denabled
  `- 7:0:0:1 sdb 8:16 failed undef running

It is in the failed state, but when it comes back to an online ALUA =
state, the path
will return to active. There is an inconsistency since if the device was =
in any other
state than unavailable when it was discovered and then transitions to =
the unavailable
state, the device is already created so it can be transitioned in =
multipath and all
is good.

Is there a way to handle both unintended consequence and the ALUA =
unavailable state?

Thanks,
Brian
