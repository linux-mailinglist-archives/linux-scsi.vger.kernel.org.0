I did not submit that patch on the lists, because I am not convinced this is
the right approach. It is a "hack" right now. As mentioned, the problem is =
that
scsi and ata pm resume are running at the same time because the dev/pm code
does not seem to know the dependency between the devices (struct dev). Would
need to dig further into that first to see if a cleaner solution can be cod=
ed.
Will try, but busy, so it may take some time. I first need to be able to
recreate the issue on my systems. Will start with that :)
