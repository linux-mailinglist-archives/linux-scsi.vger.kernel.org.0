I took another look at the git history and I can't find a single dts -
either upstream or in any downstream tree - that specifies that second
reg.

So per my argument below, if you could include a patch that just removes
the "dev_ref_clk_ctrl_mem" reference from the binding and driver I would
be happy to r-b that and ack this patch.
