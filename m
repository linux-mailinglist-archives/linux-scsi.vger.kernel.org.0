erm ... not quite sure what you mean by 'bitset'.  Are you saying that
you want to store a number between [0..511] at a particular offset in
the array?  If so, you want xa_mk_value(N) to turn a value into an xarray
entry.  When you load it, you can check it's a value with xa_is_value()
and convert it back to an integer with xa_to_value().  You han have up
to 31/63 bits that way, depending on sizeof(void *).

Sounds like you really want more search marks.  This is a relatively common request and is disappointingly hard to do efficiently with the current XArray.
It's a request that should be solved with the new data structure, but
see earlier comments on when you might see that.

In the meantime, you might consider using an IDA for an efficient
expandable bitmap.  It's built on top of the XArray, but stores only
one bit per index instead of a pointer.  You'd need nine IDAs for nine
bits of state ...
