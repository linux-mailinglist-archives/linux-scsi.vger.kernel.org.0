But qlogic has smaller .can_queue which looks at most 512, .can_queue is
the depth for allocating sbitmap, since each sdev->queue_depth is <=
.can_queue.

I will post the patch after running some benchmark to make sure no
performance regression.

It seems possible to use more than one single word in one map in case
that depth is high enough, so it is still nothing to with this case.
