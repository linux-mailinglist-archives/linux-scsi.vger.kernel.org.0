Hi Ming, sorry for confusion. this case didn't always fail in our tests, and unfortunately,
due to some code problem, the kmsg.xz attached in the original mail is from PASS test.
(In failed tests, we cannot generate the kmsg so far actually)

However, in our tests, the regression is clear, for parent commit, the test all passed,
for this commit, the tests are easy to fail.

----------------  --------------------------  
           :18          50%           9:18    suspend_stress.fail

@Rui also helped double confirm the regression by another power test - analyze_suspend, which
also shows this clear regression. Rui maybe could supply more information. Thanks!
