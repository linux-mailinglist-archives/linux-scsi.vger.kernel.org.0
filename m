In reverse order ...

-- IETF Consensus:=20

My sense of the IETF view on secure hashes is that MD5 and SHA1 are broken,=
 whereas the SHA2 algorithms are proving to be longer-lived (more resistant=
 to attack) than expected, and the SHA3 algorithms are fine.

That suggests that registration of codepoints for both SHA2 and SHA3 would =
be a good thing to do, as opposed to only SHA3.  I'd suggest starting with =
either SHA-256 or SHA-512/256 (both are SHA2 hashes) in addition to SHA3-25=
6, as all three have the same 256-bit output size.

Figuring out exactly what should be done here (e.g., which SHA2 variant to =
register) would benefit from some discussion at IETF.  I would start with t=
he Security Area's saag@ietf.org mailing list.  In addition, as iSCSI falls=
 within IETF's Transport Area, the Transport Area Directors ought to be loo=
ped in beforehand.  Fortunately, publication of an RFC is not necessary, be=
cause ...

-- IANA assignments

... the Registration Procedure for PPP Authentication Algorithms is Expert =
Review.   The long version of what that means is in Section 4.5 of RFC 8126=
: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8126#section-4.5.  The short version is th=
at a request for allocation of these codepoints is submitted to IANA, whose=
 designated expert then makes a decision.  It's probably a good idea for th=
at request to state that the intended usage is iSCSI, and say that it's ok =
to restrict the resulting registrations solely to use by iSCSI.

As Christoph notes, I've helped with IANA interactions at NVMe, and would b=
e likewise willing to help here.  My name is attached to the SHA1 registrat=
ion, so it would make sense for me to ask for the SHA2 and SHA3 registratio=
ns, and I know a number of the people who will be involved in ensuring that=
 the proverbial "right thing" happens, e.g., the Transport Area Directors.

Thanks, --David
