--- Comment #47 from Paul Ausbeck (paula@alumni.cse.ucsc.edu) ---
The PCI/GPU messages are only connected to the ATA messages in the sense th=
at
the PCI/GPU activity is unexpectedly deferred until after ATA init is compl=
ete.
Since resuming of devices is supposedly asynchronous, one would have thought
that PCI/GPU init activity would be completed long before hdd spin up is
complete.

I realize that deferring drive spin up until needed would not be easy, that=
's
why I called such an idea a tour de force. In the past it may have been com=
mon
for an ata device to not resume reliably, but today even the 10 year old ata
devices on my Ivy Bridge machine resume just as reliably as they normally
operate, which is quite reliably. If it weren't for power outages, I'd have
years of continuous uptime. It's just a thought, but it may be time to revi=
sit
how disks, especially spinning disks, are resumed. It seems to me that the
chance of a hdd failure during resume is not any greater than at any other
time. It should be theoretically possible to queue up resume commands and
execute them only when needed to service actual demand. The latency would h=
ave
to eventually be absorbed, but if the api's are designed and implemented
properly that would just happen when needed.
