The LUN range is 64 bit.
I was under the impression that xarray can only handle up to unsigned 
long; which probably would work for 64bit systems, but there _are_ users 
running on 32 bit, and they get patently unhappy when we have to tell 
them 'sorry, not for you'.

At least I _know_ that I'll get complaints if I try a stunt like this.

If you can make xarray 64 bit on all systems, sure, I'm game.

Cheers,

Hannes
