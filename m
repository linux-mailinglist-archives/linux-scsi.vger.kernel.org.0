I would kill the 'channel' object, and use a combined 'channel':'target' 
index for the scsi target. The 'channel' really is only a number, and
doesn't have an object on its own.
And for the LUN numbers I doubt we need to have two lookup arrays; one
32bit array would be sufficient to hold basically _all_ installations
I've seen so far (I've yet to come across on installation using more 
than two LUN levels).
What we could to is use the index into REPORT LUNs as the array index;
things might shuffle around there if someone remaps devices, but that's
a tough one even nowadays.

Lemme see...

Cheers,

Hannes
