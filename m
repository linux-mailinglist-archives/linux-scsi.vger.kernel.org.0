When a driver's shutdown method is called it may be still processing in
parallel I/Os (that may also happen any time later) so not releasing the
resources the driver has allocated is correct. A next step is then a
power off or a boot of a new kernel anyway.
A driver should stop DMA transfers and IRQ's, silence itself and when
needed inform the attached hw to flush memory or whatever else.

(The fix I've posted for the DMA issue in shutdown has this subject
'mpt3sas: fix an issue when driver's being removed')

Tomas
