Hello David,

first of all, thank for your reply and your offer to help with this.
We appreciate this a lot.

Agree. Having SHA-256 would make sense.

Ok, I am going to send an email for the SAAG mailing list to see what they think about it.

The long version of what that means is in Section 4.5 of RFC 8126: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8126#section-4.5.  The short version is that a request for allocation of these codepoints is submitted to IANA, whose designated expert then makes a decision.  It's probably a good idea for that request to state that the intended usage is iSCSI, and say that it's ok to restrict the resulting registrations solely to use by iSCSI.

My name is attached to the SHA1 registration, so it would make sense for me to ask for the SHA2 and SHA3 registrations, and I know a number of the people who will be involved in ensuring that the proverbial "right thing" happens, e.g., the Transport Area Directors.

Thank you very much for the help!
