+1 on Keith's comments. Also, if a ns depth limit needs to be 
introduced, it should be via the nvme committee and then reported back 
as device attributes. Many of SCSI's problems where the protocol didn't 
solve it, especially in multi-initiator environments, which made all 
kinds of requirements/mish-mashes on host stacks and target behaviors. 
none of that should be repeated.
