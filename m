You don't have to. To quote RFC 3720 page 122:

      bit 5 - (O) set for Residual Overflow.  In this case, the Residual
        Count indicates the number of bytes that were not transferred
        because the initiator's Expected Data Transfer Length was not
        sufficient.  For a bidirectional operation, the Residual Count
        contains the residual for the write operation.

IE the 'overflow' setting in the iSCSI command response is an indicator 
that there _would_ be more data if the command request _would_ have 
specified a larger buffer.
But as it didn't, the entire buffer was filled, and the overflow counter 
is set.
Which, of course, is then ignored by the linux SCSI stack as the request 
got all data, and the residual is set to zero.
Then it's left to the caller to re-send with a larger buffer if 
required. But it's nothing the SCSI stack can nor should be attempting 
on its own.

As such I think the patch is correct.
