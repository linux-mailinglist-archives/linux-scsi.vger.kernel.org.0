Brian, Martin,=20

sorry, I've overlooked this patch previously. I have to say I think
it's wrong and shouldn't have been applied. At least I need more in-
depth explanation.

Can you please show me a quote from the specs on which this expectation
("without a path failure") is based? AFAIK the SCSI specs don't say
anything about device-mapper multipath semantics.

dm multipath has no concept of "transitioning" state. Path state can be
either active or inactive. As Brian wrote, commands sent to the
transitioning device will return NOT READY, TRANSITIONING, and require
retries on the SCSI layer. If we know this in advance, why should we
continue sending I/O down this semi-broken path? If other, healthy
paths are available, why it would it not be the right thing to switch
I/O to them ASAP?

I suppose the problem you want to solve here is a transient situation
in which all paths are transitioning (some up, some down), which would
lead to a failure on the dm level (at least with no_path_retry=3D0). IMO
this has to be avoided at the firmware level, and if that is
impossible, multipath-tools' (no_path_retry * polling_interval) must be
set to a value that is higher than the time for which this transient
degraded situation would persist.

Am I missing something?

The way I see it, this is a problem that affects only storage from one
vendor, and would cause suboptimal behavior on most others. If you
really need this, I would suggest a new devinfo flag, e.g.
BLIST_DONT_FAIL_TRANSITIONING.

Martin
