ouch - What you are describing is likely true, but sli-2 firmware is 
*extremely* old - 2 decades or more. If a change wont work first shot, 
it likely won't be worth the effort to try to fix it. Other 
functionality may be hanging on by a thread.  That adapter certainly 
runs SLI-3 (even that is 10-15 yrs old), so the best solution is a fw 
upgrade that picks up the sli3 interface. Is that possible?

Given that the error message you quoted was a failure of interrupt, that 
may be a clue. It may well be the adapter has sli3 firmware and it's 
failing on setting the interrupt vector type.  The older adapters 
supported MSI and INTx. SLI-2 may have been limited to INTx only. There 
used to be hiccups in some platforms with MSI support (platform said it 
did, but was broken) which is why the driver had "set it, test it, 
revert it" logic. I believe the driver has a lpfc_use_msi module 
parameter that when set to 0 should use only INTx, which may be what the 
sli2 downgrade is effectively doing. Try setting that and seeing if the 
card loads the sli3 image and runs.
