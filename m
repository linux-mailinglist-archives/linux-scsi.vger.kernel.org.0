IBM decided to retire a lot of the content that was previously hosted on
"developerworks", and so some of the links we've used for documentation
are now dead or redirect to some general landing page with no correlation
to what the links were meant to provide.

Change the provided link in the Kconfig file for zfcp to rather refer to
our device drivers book that we regularly update and publish for free,
and whose name hasn't been changed since it was first published.

Our hardware is also not called "IBM eServer zSeries" anymore - in fact,
it hasn't been called like that since 2006. Use a broader term that
covers different server names over time.

Lastly, add a short paragraph about how our HBAs are typically named, to
have some more tangible references.
