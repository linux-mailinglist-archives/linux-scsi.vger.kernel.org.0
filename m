This is a brave change proposal. The masked_status has been tricked
up so it won't break user code. However the driver byte is exposed
by the sg v2, v3 and v4 interfaces which means via bsg device nodes,
sg devices nodes and many other block storage device nodes (e.g.
/dev/sdc and /dev/st1) via:
       ioctl(<storage_dev>, SG_IO, ptr_to_v3_interface) .

So if there is any user space code out there that checks the
driver byte (e.g. 'sg_io_hdr::driver_status & DRIVER_SENSE') do we
have a problem?

If so, we could hack the DRIVER_SENSE case *** by putting it back
for the user space to see when the driver (e.g. sg) knows there
is sense data. What about the other values?

It is hard to make an omelette without breaking some eggs.

*** Here is a snippet from sg3_utils library code:

     if ((SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION == scsi_status) ||
         (SAM_STAT_COMMAND_TERMINATED == scsi_status) ||
         (SG_LIB_DRIVER_SENSE == masked_driver_status))
         return sg_err_category_sense(sense_buffer, sb_len);

Due to the logical OR, as long as SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION is set
whenever there is sense, then we don't care about DRIVER_SENSE.

I believe this code comes from the days before auto-sense when say a
READ(6) would fail, send back a CHECK_CONDITION and the host would then
need to issue a REQUEST SENSE command to get the sense data. However
REQUEST SENSE could itself yield a CHECK_CONDITION. Hence DRIVER_SENSE
set, SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION clear could be interpreted as the
initial command failing and the follow-up REQUEST SENSE succeeded; if
they are both set, then both commands failed (e.g. the disk has gone
away).
