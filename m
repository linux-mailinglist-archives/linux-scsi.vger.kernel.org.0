--- Comment #19 from Dieter Mummenschanz (dmummenschanz@web.de) ---
Hallo Niklas,

thanks for getting back to me on that.

> Please consider writing to the libata mailing list instead of using

> that way.

Could point me to that mailing list please. I can't seem to find it. Do you
want me to repost the issue there or is it okay to just copy & past the
messages from this bug?


> It appears that you have built your kernel with:
> CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY=3D0


Definately not! I've attached my kernel config. LPM policy is definately se=
t tp
"3" CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY=3D3. Thats puzzles me because after booti=
ng the=20
link_power_management_policy is set to performance. Somehow the kernel
overrides the config or uses parameters suggested by the BIOS I don't know.
I've also tried to to switch the ASPM polity to Powersave instead of BIOS
default. Didn't help.

The print is not called, right but not because of
CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY=3D0 since It is set to "3". However when I fo=
rce=20
link_power_management_policy to "echo med_power_with_dipm" the message appe=
ars
in dmesg:

[    9.434663] ahci 0000:00:17.0: setting devsleep to: 0 port support 0
[    9.434668] ahci 0000:00:17.0: port does not support device sleep
[    9.434674] ahci 0000:00:17.0: setting devsleep to: 0 port support 0
[    9.434678] ahci 0000:00:17.0: port does not support device sleep

so somehow the LPM Policy is either not set or reset by the kernel I assume.

Not quite. In 6.6 the PC8 transition worked only when forcing
link_power_management_policy to "echo med_power_with_dipm". The policy was
still performance after bootup like it is in 6.7-rc. The only difference I =
see
is that after resume my laptop won't enter PC8 again. For 6.7-rc I have to =
call
hdparm -Y for sda and sdb after resume to enable the transition.=20

Attached to this bug for both (identical) drives.

My Laptop BIOS (INSYDE) does not offer any knobs to tune dleep for any ATA =
or
PCI devices. Only thing I have set is the powersave profile.

Thats confusing :(

Me neither but it works. :(

As described above I'm doing this for years during bootup otherwise I'm stu=

at PC2.

How can I tell?

Okay and how do I so that?

Kind regards,
