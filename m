That section of the spec mentions both implicit and explicit. For
implicit, the target can want to rebalance resources for things like
a resource is down permanently, or you add more ports, or we bring
up/down resources dynamically based on usage or maintenance.

For implicit, the target knows. It's initiating the transition based
on whatever metrics or resources it has. We want the initiator to let us
complete what we are doing.

For explicit, then again the target knows what it wants to do when
it gets the STPG and we only it to set the paths to optimized. So
if it goes that route where it completes the STPG before the transition
completes, then goes into transitioning, then we can just let the
device do it's transitions.

You are referring to the issue Hannes mentions where multipath can pick
up the transitioning state and it might get confused, right? I'm not
sure what to do.

Sort of.

Ideally I think it would be nice if we blocked the device/queue for
normal IO, then just sent a RTPG every N secs or msecs until we changed
state or until the timer expired. We then unblock and either fail upwards
or dispatch. I think this is a lot of work though.

The problem with constant dispatching is that on low latency systems we
retry too quickly. I had to add a little sleep on the target side for this
or we hammer the target/initiator too hard and we got warnings (I can't
remember the exact warn/err).
