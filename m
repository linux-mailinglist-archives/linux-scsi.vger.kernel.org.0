I suspect you are talking about resume from hybernation here, where the drive
may have been completely powered off... Yes, in such case, the drive will
spinup, unless you have PUIS and enabled it.

Sure, but please do not have this delay this patch series. The problem you are
describing above exists today already. This patch series is not making it worse,
nor is it trying to solve it. And note that this issue is not just for ATA. SCSI
devices locally attached to a machine that you hybernate will end up doing the
same and spinup when power is restored...
