I actually mean io_uring with IOPOLL support. I will fix this.

I guess you mean non-IRQ mode = There will not be any msix vector associated
for poll_queues and h/w can still work in this mode.
If above is correct, yes both the controller can support non-IRQ mode, but
we need support of shared host tag as well for completeness of this feature
in driver.
Both the h/w are single submission queue and multiple reply queue, but using
shared host tagset support we will enable simulated multiple hw queue.

I have megaraid_sas driver patch available and it does identical to what
NVME driver does.  Driver allocates some extra  reply queues and it will be
marked as poll_queue.
This poll_queue will not have associated msix vectors. All the IO completion
on this queue will be done from IOPOLL interface.

I tested megaraid_sas driver having 8 poll_queues and using io_uring
hiprio=1 settings. It can reach 3.2M IOPs and there is *zero* interrupt.
This is what NVME does so I assume this is what you wanted to confirm here.

Thanks for review.
