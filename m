Correct that it only happens with BFQ, but whether it's a BFQ bug or
not just depends on how you define the has_work() API.  If has_work()
is allowed to be in-exact then it's either a blk-mq bug or a SCSI bug
depending on how you cut it.  If has_work() must be exact then it is
certainly a BFQ bug.  If has_work() doesn't need to be exact then it's
not a BFQ bug.  I believe that a sane API could be defined either way.
Either has_work() can be defined as a lightweight hint to trigger
heavier code or it can be defined as something exact.  It's really up
to blk-mq to say how they define it.

From his response on the SCSI patch [1], it sounded like Jens was OK
with has_work() being a lightweight hint as long as BFQ ensures that
the queues run later.  ...but, as my investigation found, I believe
that BFQ _does_ try to ensure that the queue is run at a later time by
calling blk_mq_run_hw_queues().  The irony is that due to the race
we're talking about here, blk_mq_run_hw_queues() isn't guaranteed to
be reliable if has_work() is inexact.  :(  One way to address this is
to make blk_mq_run_hw_queues() reliable even if has_work() is inexact.

...so Jens: care to clarify how you'd like has_work() to be defined?

Just to confirm: it sounds like you are saying that BFQ is not a first
class citizen here because not everyone uses BFQ.  Is that really the
best policy?  Couldn't I say that SCSI shouldn't be a first class
citizen because not everyone uses SCSI?  In such a case I could argue
that we should speed up the blk-mq layer by removing all the budget
code since SCSI is the only user.  I'm not actually suggesting it,
only pointing out that sometimes we need to make allowances in the
code.

I always struggle when working with memory barriers.  I think you are
saying that this section of code is OK, though, presumably because the
SCSI code does "atomic_inc_return" which implies this barrier.

Do you happen to know if it's documented that anyone who implements
get_budget() for "struct blk_mq_ops" will have a memory barrier here?
I know SCSI is the only existing user, but we'd want to keep it
generic.

OK, thanks.  I will add that we decide to move forward with this
patch.  Again I'd wonder if this type of thing should be documented.

Yes, but it is a fairly minor cost added.  It's called once in a place
where we're unlikely to be looping and where we're about to do a lot
heavier operations (perhaps in a loop).  This doesn't feel like a
dealbreaker.

Apparently I'm the only one who feels atomic_t is more documenting
here.  I will cede to the will of the majority here and change to
'unsigned int' if we decide to move forward with this patch.
