Yes, there is currently no fix for the problem, and it doesn't usually 
happen. Once it occurs, the device will be unavailable and difficult to 
locate. In addition, there are many possibilities for the failure of 
devtmpfs to create a dev node, including currently recognized scenarios 
and memory allocation failures, etc.
