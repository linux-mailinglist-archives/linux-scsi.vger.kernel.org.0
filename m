Hi Hannes,

Any chance you can repost this series? I'm being a bit of a nag :)

It now looks like some drivers may also need this for supporting 
io_uring in SCSI mid-layer:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20201015133541.60400-1-kashyap.desai@broadcom.com/

And it's also useful for the runtime PM which we were supporting for 
hisi_sas, to track IOs.

I know that you were hoping for a few more reviews, but I don't think 
that they are coming for v6 now. And at least I gave a few comments 
here, like:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/b03c1256-8255-5e7f-dda3-df036aaef812@huawei.com/

And there were other comments.

Please let me know.

Cheers,
John
