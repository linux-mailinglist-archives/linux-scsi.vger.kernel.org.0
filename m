My bad. struct bio->bi_ioprio is an unsigned short. I got confused with the user
API and kernel functions using an int in many places. We really should change
the kernel functions to use unsigned short for ioprio everywhere.

Well, if Jens is OK with adding another "unsigned short bi_lifetime" in a hole
in struct bio, that's fine with me. Otherwise, we are back to discussing how to
pack bi_ioprio in a sensible manner so that we do not create a mess between the
use cases and APIs:
1) inode based lifetime with FS setting up the bi_ioprio field
2) Direct IOs to files of an FS with lifetime set by user per IO (e.g.
aio/io_uring/ioprio_set()) and/or fcntl()
3) Direct IOs to raw block devices with lifetime set by user per IO (e.g.
aio/io_uring/ioprio_set())

Any of the above case should also allow using ioprio class/level and CDL hint.

I think the most problematic part is (2) when lifetime are set with both fcntl()
and per IO: which lifetime is the valid one ? The one set with fcntl() or the
one specified for the IO ? I think the former is the one we want here.

If we can clarify that, then I guess using 3 or 4 bits from the 10 bits ioprio
hint should be OK. That would  give you 7 or 15 lifetime values. Enough no ?
