Will do that in V2.

Not sure what you meant about the same problem.

It is definitely bad to unconditionally call blk_mq_run_hw_queues()
in driver's IO completion handler from performance viewpoint.

This patch simply addresses this SCSI specific issue, since blk_mq_run_hw_q=
ueues()
shouldn't be called from scsi_end_request() when the device queue isn't bus=
y.

If other driver has such kind of issue, I believe it should have been fixed=
 in
driver too.

So my patch isn't contradictory with Long's patch which improves generic bl=
k-mq's
run queue.

Thanks,
Ming
