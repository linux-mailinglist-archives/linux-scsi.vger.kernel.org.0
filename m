Agreed

We did discuss libata before, but I'm not sure on the context you mean.

One thing that I know is that libata-core has "internal" commands in 
ata_exec_internal(). I could not see how that function could be 
converted to use queue_rq. The problem is that it calls ->qc_issue() 
with IRQs disabled, which is not permitted for calling blk_execute_rq() 
instead.

I don't recall that one.

I think that any driver which uses reserved commands needs to be thought 
that not all commands are "real" scsi commands, i.e. we don't call 
scsi_done() in the LLD ISR always. As such, they should be able to deal 
with something like struct scsi_rsvd_cmnd.

BTW, for this current series, please ensure that we can't call 
scsi_host_complete_all_commands() which could iter reserved tags, as we 
call stuff like scsi_done() there. I don't think it's an issue here, but 
just thought that it was worth mentioning.

They are indeed interlinked in the block layer, but we don't need expose 
requests or anything else.

Such an interface could just be a wrapper for 
blk_mq_alloc_request()+_start_request().

If we send for the host request queue, would it ever be 
blocked/frozen/quiesced?

So do you suggest a dummy bio for that request? I hacked something 
locally to get it to work as a PoC, but no idea on a real solution yet.

Agreed
