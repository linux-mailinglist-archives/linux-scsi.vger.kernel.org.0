I just tried it and it worked. If we only clear ex_phy's 
attached_sas_addr, there is no need to call sas_destruct_ports(). We are 
currently using sas_unregister_devs_sas_addr() which will add the port 
to sas_port_del_list, so we need to call sas_destruct_ports() separately 
to delete the port.

Should we also delete the port after the devices probe failed?

Maybe I can update another version and only clear ex_phy's 
attached_sas_addr based on your suggestions.

As described above, if we only clear ex_phy's attached_sas_addr, we do 
not need to call sas_destruct_ports().
