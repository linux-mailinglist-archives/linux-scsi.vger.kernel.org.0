I've replied your similar question in previous series. I've seen too 
much
SSU cmd and SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE cmd timed out these years, 60s is not even
enough for them to complete. And you are right, most cases are that 
device
is not responding - UFS controller is busy with housekeeping.

Sigh... I also want my life and work to be easier... I agree with you.

In project bring up stage, we fix whatever error/bug/failure we face to
unblock the project, during which we only focus on and try to fix the 
very
first UFS error, but not quite care about the error recovery or what the
error can possibly cause (usually more UFS errors and system stability 
issues
follow the very first UFS error).

However, these years our customers tend to ask for more - they want UFS 
error
handling to recover everything whenever UFS error occurs, because they 
believe
it is the last line of defense after their products go out to market. So 
I took
a lot of effort fixing, testing and trying to make it robust. Now here 
we are.
FYI, I am on a tight schedule to have these UFS error handling changes 
ready in
Android12-5.10.

Thanks,

Can Guo.
