Wow good digging! I knew the test would be good for something.
Like for maintaining the test.

Fixing things in the UAPI headers make it easier to do things right
going forward with classes and all.

IIRC that was because there were no UAPI headers when the test
was created, I don't think I was just randomly lazy... Well maybe I
was. The numbers are ABI anyway, not the header files.

Yeah one of the reasons the kernel fails is in order to be
able to slot in new behaviour in response to these ioctls,
so the test should probably just be updated to also test
the new scheduling classes and all that, using the UAPI
headers.

Will you send a patch?
