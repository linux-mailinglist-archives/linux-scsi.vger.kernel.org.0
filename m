I wasn't (and still isn't) sure how much I should bump.  Maybe 36000 /
3.6.0 will do? (Seems to deserve the bigger bump)

"this ioctl value replicates what a block layer device file (e.g.
/dev/sda) will do with the same value. It calls the
queue_max_sectors() helper on the owning device's command queue. The
resulting number represents the maximum number of logical sectors of a
single request that the block layer will accept."? and for BLKSSZGET
"the resulting number represents the logical sector size"?
