Actually, that's not the way it works: vendors add commands because
standards mandate.  That's why people who want weird commands go and
join standard committees.  Unfortunately this means that a lot of the
commands the standard mandates end up not being very useful in
practice.  For instance in SCSI we really only implement a fraction of
the commands in the standard.

In this case, the industry already tried a very similar approach with
GEN 1 hybrid drives and it turned into a complete disaster, which is
why the mode became optional in shingle drives and much better modes,
which didn't have the huge shared state problem, superseded it.  Plus
truncating the LBA of a READ 16 to 4 bytes is asking for capacity
problems down the line, so even the actual implementation seems to be
problematic.

All in all, this looks like a short term fix which will go away when
the drive capacity improves and thus all the effort changing the driver
will eventually be wasted.

Um, does it?  I don't believe even the UFS people have claimed this. 
The problem is that HPB creates a shared state between the driver and
the device.  That shared state has to be populated, which has to happen
at start of day, so it's entirely unclear if this is a win or a slow
down for boot.
