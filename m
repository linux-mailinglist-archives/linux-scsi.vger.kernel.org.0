Is this the latest available FW for this HBA ? (see below)

Unfortunately, I do not have any megaraid model so I cannot test/recreate. I
only have mpt3sas (9300, 9400 and 9500 series HBAs) and mpi3mr models (9600 HBA
series).

I do not think that the drives are relevant for this issue. How the HBA react
to a command error from the drive resulting from the HBA command translation
likely is the issue.

> If you need any additional information, please let us know!

Adding the Broadcom folks to this thread, since as suspected, this seems to be
an HBA issue. I strongly suspect that it relates to a recent very similar issue
I have seen with the mpi3mr driver and a 9600 Broadcom HBA: any hotplug of a
drive would completely crash the HBA and a full power cycle was needed to
recover. A simple reboot would not be sufficient. I think the latest HBA FW
version fixes that problem.

Broadcom team,

Any comment ?
