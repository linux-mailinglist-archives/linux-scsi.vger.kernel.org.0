Thanks Alan.
CanG & I had some discussions on it as well the other day.
I'm now looking into creating a device link between the siblings.
e.g. make the device wlun as a supplier for all the other luns & wluns.
So device wlun (supplier) wouldn't suspend (runtime/system) until all of the other
consumers are suspended. After this linking, I can move all the
pm commands that are being sent by host to the dedicated suspend routine of the device
wlun and the host needn't send any cmds during its suspend and layering
violation wouldn't take place.
