Yes. But my point here is that any residual values are handled (and 
defined) at the protocol level. Any SCSI midlayer protocol like SPC or, 
indeed, SAM have no concept of residuals.

THe SCSI midlayer chose to add a residual value to document the number 
of bytes _not_ being handled from hardware.

As mentioned, this needs to be handled in the submission path, and the 
command should be aborted before being sent to the drive.

See above. We should intercept such a command, and simply abort it with 
an appropriate error.
That goes for internal commands, of course; I know it doesn't work for 
things like sg_raw, but one could argue that this was precisely the 
point of that command ...
