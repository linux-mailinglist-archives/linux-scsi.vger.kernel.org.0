Our controller supports both SCSI and NVMe. In current raid mode, it only supports SAS/SATA disks.
and reports SCSI disk to host after creating raid group. In this use case, SCSI is the protocol and the spraid driver is needed.
In another mode, controller can support NVMe disks and works with the NVMe driver in linux kernel.
To reduce the complexity, NVMe mechanism is used as the communication method between driver and controller so that we can use the same interface for both SCSI and NVMe.
