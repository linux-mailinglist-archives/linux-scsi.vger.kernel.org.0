I have tried this:
     if (!try_module_get(THIS_MODULE)) {
          pr_warn("%s: probable rmmod, stop adding\n", __func__);
          break;
     }
     module_put(THIS_MODULE);
     ....

placed inside the loop that adds each host inside scsi_debug_init() and
I can never get try_modules_get() to fail. There is a 'rmmod scsi_debug'
bash script sending a rmmod every 0.3 seconds. To slow scsi_debug down
there is a 0.5 second delay on each media access command. The overall
modprobe takes over 10 seconds but scsi_debug_init() is only about 0.8
seconds of that. The rest of the time is udev and friends piling on,
sending SCSI commands to the newly appearing devices. And whenever the
driver is processing commands then rmmod is going to get EBUSY which is
exactly what is observed.

The kernel try_module_get() documentation is underwhelming. Is there some
kind of synchronization between this call and rmmod? Does a failed rmmod
leave a persistent flag that a following try_module_get() will notice and
return false? If so, what if the user changes their mind? If not, how is
this meant to be useful?

This will depend on how quickly sysfs visibility appears (i.e.
/sys/bus/pseudo/drivers/scsi_debug/* ) after modprobe is started.
