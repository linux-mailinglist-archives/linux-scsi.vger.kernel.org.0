FWIW, I've pushed my hack branch[1] out with a couple of patches
for you to try (the top 3 patches). They allow platform-MSI domains
created by devices (mbigen, ICU) to be advertised as shared between
devices, so that the low-level driver can handle that in an appropriate
way.

I gave it a go on my D05 and nothing blew up, but I can't really remove
the kernel module, as that's where my disks are... :-/
Please let me know if that helps.

Bah, it's a simple change, and there is now more than the mbigen using
the same API...

I don't think the driver should mess with interrupts it doesn't own.
And while the mbigen port that is connected to the SAS controller
doesn't seem to be shared between endpoints, some other ports definitely
are:

# cat /sys/kernel/debug/irq/domains/\\_SB.MBI1
name:   \_SB.MBI1
  size:   409
  mapped: 192
  flags:  0x00000003

[...]

I guess that the other 217 lines are connected somewhere.

I'm happy to look at some code! ;-)
