Some more background is that this is all related to the "reserved" 
commands work. The issue is that it is difficult to differentiate 
between this libsas softreset command and normal ATA queued commands - 
the normal check is "is the device associated sata", but that doesn't 
work. If we could always have a ATA queued command, then that would be 
better. But, as you say, it is too high level.

Let me check what else I would do. BTW, I will send an update on that 
work in a day or so.

yeah, that would seem a good consolidation.

Thanks!
