FYI we have exactly this issue on a machine here running CentOS 8.3 =
(kernel 4.18.0-240.1.1) (so presumably this happens in RHEL 8 too.)

Controller is MSCC / Adaptec 3154-8i16e driving 60 x 12TB HGST drives =
configured as five x twelve-drive raid-6, software striped using md, and =
formatted with xfs.

Test software writes to the array using multiple threads in parallel.

The smartpqi driver would report controller offline within ten minutes =
or so, with status code 0x6100c

Changed the driver to set 'nr_hw_queues =3D 1=E2=80=99 and then tested =
by filling the array with random files (which took a couple of days), =
which completed fine, so it looks like that one-line change fixes it.

Would, of course, be helpful if this was back-ported.

=E2=80=94
