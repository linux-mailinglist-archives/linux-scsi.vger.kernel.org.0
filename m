I am not really familiar with the IO area to answer this. The base idea
is to start the NOIO scope at the boundary which defines "unsafe to
re-enter or cannot deal with a new IO" from the reclaim path.

Could you elaborate?

kmem_cache_alloc is only an extension to allow to allocate from a
specific cache. I do not really see how it is going to help with larger
allocation and my current understanding is that kvmalloc is used because
the requested allocation size can be large.
