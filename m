Please consider this rewrite:

Currently the HiSilicon SAS controller v3 hw driver supports runtime PM. 
However a number of corner-case bugs have been reported for this 
feature. These include:
a. If a directly-attached disk is removed when the host is suspended a 
system hang may occur during resume. libsas drains events after resuming 
the host. Draining the events causes a deadlock as we need to ensure 
that the host is resumed for some libsas events processing, however the 
resume process will not complete until all events are processed.
b. If a disk is attached to an expander when the host is suspended then 
this new disk will not be detected when active again.
c. The host controller may not resume from suspension when sending SMP IOs.
d. If a phy comes up when resuming the host controller then we may get a 
deadlock from processing of events DISCE_DISCOVER_DOMAIN and 
PORTE_BYTES_DMAED.
e. Similar to d., the work of PORTE_BROADCAST_RCVD and PORTE_BYTES_DMAED 
may deadlock.

This series addresses those issues, briefly described as follows:
a. As far as we can see, this drain is unneeded, so conditionally remove.
b. Just insert broadcast events to revalidate the topology.
c. and e. When processing any events from the LLD, make libsas keep the 
host active until finished processing all work related to that original 
event.
d. Defer phyup event processing in case described.
