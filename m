To make sure I got this you are saying before iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_stop =
calls iscsi_sw_tcp_release_conn that the recv path has called =
iscsi_recv_pdu right?

I think this might have 2 issues:

1. It only fixes iscsi_tcp. What about other drivers that free/null =
resources/fields in ep_disconnect that we layer need to access in the =
set_param callback (the cxgbi drivers)?

2. What about drivers that do not free/null fields (be2iscsi, bnx2i, =
ql4xxx and qedi) so the set_param calls end up just working. What state =
will userspace be in where we have logged in, but iscsid also thinks we =
are in the middle of trying to login?

I think we could do:

1. On ep_disconnect and stop_conn set some iscsi_cls_conn bit that =
indicates set_param calls for connection level settings should fail. =
scsi_transport_iscsi could set and check this bit for all drivers.
2. On bind_conn clear the bit.=
