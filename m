Have you tested this on any other hardware?  the reason most legacy
hardware would have a setting like this is because they have a two byte
transfer length register and zero doesn't mean 65536.  If this is the
case for any of the cards the zorro_esp drives, it might be better to
lower the max length to 61440 (64k-4k) so the residual is a page.
