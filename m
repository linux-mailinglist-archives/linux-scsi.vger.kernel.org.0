But there is no synchronization with EH that I can see anyway. At least for
sd_remove(), I would assume that this is called only once the device references
were all dropped, so presumably EH is not doing anything with the drive when
that happen, no ?

In any case, looking at dev->power.runtime_status is not correct as this is set
to RPM_ACTIVE when the device is suspended through system suspend. We could
replace the test "sdkp->device->host->shost_state != SHOST_RUNNING" with
"dev->power.is_suspended", as that indicates true (1) for a suspended device.
However, I really do not like that as that is a PM internal field and should not
be accessing it directly. The PM code comments say as much. Any better idea ?
