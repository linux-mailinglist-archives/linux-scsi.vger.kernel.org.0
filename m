Patch to use fixed size buffer for the buggy MODE SENSE command

Hardware:
   HBA card: Broadcom / LSI SAS1068 PCI-X Fusion-MPT SAS
PCI VID:PID: 1000:0054

Problem: Caching mode of logical volumes managed by the controller in quest=
ion
is not detected.

Relevant kernel messages:
[   19.642388] scsi 8:1:0:0: Direct-Access     LSILOGIC Logical Volume   30=

[   19.666881]  sdd: sdd1 sdd2 sdd3
[   19.667776] sd 8:1:0:0: [sdd] Attached SCSI disk

Cause of the problem:
The SCSI MODE SENSE command is broken for the logical volumes managed by the
controller in question in that it does not set the length field in the retu=
rned
response to the length of the entire response but rather only to the length=
 of
the portion of the response actually written to the provided buffer (which =
is
obviously limited by the length of the provided buffer). This breaks the lo=
gic
in sd_read_cache_type [1] which first tries to determine the size of the en=
tire
response by executing the MODE SENSE command with a small buffer and then u=
ses
the length field from the partial response to size the buffer for the entire
response appropriately. This does not work for the logical volumes managed =
by
the controller in question as for them the reported response length is never
greater than the length of the provided buffer (in fact it is always 3 as
evidenced by the first byte in the "Mode Sense:" log message - which is the
length of the small buffer provided to the MODE SENSE command less the leng=
th
byte itself), so the response is never received in its entirety, which lead=
s to
the caching mode detection failure.

The problem can be demonstrated by the sg_modes command:
- invoked on the misbehaving logical volume:
# sg_modes -6 -p 8 -m 4 -d -H /dev/sdd
    LSILOGIC  Logical Volume    3000   peripheral_type: disk [0x0]
 00     03 00 00 00
- invoked on a correctly behaving disk:
# sg_modes -6 -p 8 -m 4 -d -H /dev/sda
    ATA       WDC WD4003FFBX-6  0A83   peripheral_type: disk [0x0]
 00     17 00 00 00
Notice the difference in the length field - the first byte of the response.

Nevertheless the misbehaving logical volume _does_ report the caching mode
correctly when the relevant MODE SENSE command is executed with large enough
buffer. Again this can be demonstrated by the sg_modes command:
# sg_modes -6 -p 8 -m 192 -d -H /dev/sdd
    LSILOGIC  Logical Volume    3000   peripheral_type: disk [0x0]
 00     17 00 00 00 08 12 04 00  ff ff 00 00 ff 00 ff ff
 10     00 0f 00 00 00 00 00 00

Possible fix:
It turns out there is already a flag in struct scsi_device which forces the
relevant MODE SENSE command to be executed with a 192 bytes long buffer (wh=
ich
is long enough to hold the entire response): use_192_bytes_for_3f [2].
When this flag is set for the misbehaving disk/logical volume (together with
the skip_ms_page_8 flag), the caching mode detection works correctly. This =
has
been verified by applying the attached patch.
With the patch applied, the relevant kernel messages look like this:
