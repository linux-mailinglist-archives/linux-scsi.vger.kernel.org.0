Hi Martin,

From a maintenance perspective, I think the old storage device which does
not support WRITE SAME query interface can be easily supported by adding
a workaround to the kernel, instead of waiting for the storage device to
implement the query interface.

Through my test, I found that HUAWEI's storage devices do not provide
queries for WRITE_SAME_16 support.
If the lists of such devices is written into the kernel code, will it
be incomplete and difficult to maintain? On the other hand, It would be
more flexible if we provided the module parameter 'dev_flags' to set.

Thanks
Alex
