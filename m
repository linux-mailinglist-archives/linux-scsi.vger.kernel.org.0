Hi James,

Thank you very much for the reply and for the additional background.

I would like to clarify one point about the performance regression I was
trying to describe.

I was not referring to the change from scanning one channel to scanning
multiple channels. My concern was about the change in the target ID scan
range within a single channel.

Before commit 37c4e72b0651 ("scsi: Fix sas_user_scan() to handle wildcard
and multi-channel scans"), the SAS path was effectively bounded by
rphy->scsi_target_id values discovered by the transport. After that change,
for the additional channels, the scan may go through scsi_scan_channel()
and iterate IDs in the range 0..shost->max_id when id == SCAN_WILD_CARD.

So the performance concern I had in mind was not really:

   "one channel" -> "multiple channels"

but rather:

   "scan transport-discovered IDs" -> "scan 0..max_id within a channel"

That said, after reading your reply, my current understanding is that the
motivation for 37c4e72b0651 is mainly to support controllers such as
mpt3sas and mpi3mr, where non-zero channels are meaningful and expected.

 From that perspective, it seems to me that for scenarios that do not
involve mpt3sas/mpi3mr-like usage, one option would be to simply not take
37c4e72b0651, while if we do take it, we should accept that it may bring
this kind of scan-time performance regression on some hosts.

Does that sound like a reasonable way to look at it?

Thanks again for the clarification.

Regards,
Lingfeng.
