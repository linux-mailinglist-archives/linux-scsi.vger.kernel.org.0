I agree this patch won't help, because the kernel doesn't (re)attach
devices to multipath maps by itself. If multipathd actively adds a
device to a map, it must check the WWID beforehand, and so it does (and
has been doing so for years).

But in general, it's hard to avoid WWID mismatches entirely in user
space. We have no problem if a device is removed an re-added. But if it
looks like a device just having been offline or unreachable for some
time and then reappear, it gets tricky. We might even miss the fact
that the device was temporarily away. multipathd can't constantly poll
devices just to detect changes - and what if the sysfs vpd attributes
stay the same because the kernel didn't even notice?

It would be great if userspace could rely on the kernel to deliver
events in such cases. I want look into monitoring SCSI UNIT ATTENTION
events, which multipathd currently doesn't. That might cover many
situations. But I've been told that in some situations really no event
arrived in user space, and I'm not sure if that was a fault of the
storage involved (no UNIT ATTENTION sent) or something else.

Another possibility would be that the kernel used sysfs_notify() for
the inquiry or vpd_pgXY attributes for SCSI (and similar attirbutes for
other device types).

Martin
