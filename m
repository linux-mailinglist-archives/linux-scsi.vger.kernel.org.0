Hello all,

I took another shot at this one. This one I think addresses any
concerns that were brought up:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20251114160213.21243-1-brian@purestorage=

Thanks,
Brian

I fail to see the benefit of this as both have roughly the same meaning; if=
 you have ALUA unavailable you can't access the device, hence it's complete=
ly irrelevant what PQ says. And same for the other way round: if PQ=3D1 is =
set really the only ALUA state which makes sense is 'unavailable'.
