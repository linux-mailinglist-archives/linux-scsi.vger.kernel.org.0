Repeating the same things again and again without new technical information=
 we
(developers) can act on is not very productive. So let's dig into this issu=
e to
verify *if* this is really an issue introduced by libata, which as I said, I
doubt it is. But let's make sure. So could you please try the following:
1) Build the latest 6.5-rc1 kernel from git and try with that kernel to see=
 if
the issue is still there.
2) If the issue is not resolved, with that same kernel, please try to revert
commit 6aa0365a3c85.
3) Regardless of the result for (2) please do a bisect to see if the commit
responsible for the issue is indeed 6aa0365a3c85. You can find information =
on
how to do that in the Linux documentation at
Documentation/admin-guide/bug-bisect.rst. You may also want to read=20
Documentation/admin-guide/quickly-build-trimmed-linux.rst
4) Please provide the output of lspci and a full dmesg for your system. dme=
sg
output after boot and after resume would be helpful.

With the above information, we will likely have a better idea of what is go=
ing
on with your machine.

Also please know that the number of machines affected by an issue only
determines the priority/urgency of a fix. Even if a single user is affected,
issues will still be addressed as long as enough information is provided and
the person affected helps with testing (as I cannot recreate that issue with
the hardware I have).

Note that I am on vacation this week, so I am only checking emails and repl=
ying
as a courtesy. I will not do anything until Tuesday next week.
