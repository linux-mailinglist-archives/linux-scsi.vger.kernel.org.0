Hi James,

That document has been created using my work account. Recently my 
employer changed the settings for work documents such that even 
read-only access has to be granted explicitly. Making a document 
viewable without authentication is no longer supported. I am considering 
next time I use Google Docs to prepare a meeting to use my personal 
gmail account since making documents public from a personal account is 
still supported.

The procedure to get access to this document is as follows:
* Log in to an account with which a Google password has been associated.
* Open the above link. The following text will appear: "You need access.
Ask for access, or switch to an account with access. Learn more. 
[Request access]".
* Select the [Request access] button.

The contents of that document so far is as follows:
* Proposed date and time of the meeting.
* Draft agenda. So far there is one item on the agenda, namely how to 
implement multiqueue support in the UFS driver without triggering lock 
contention between submitters.

PS: meeting about the UFS driver was suggested by another UFS driver 
contributor. I try to minimize the number of meetings on my calendar.

Bart.
