So this looks lacking in the kernel AFAICS...

So is there a reason for which irq dispose mapping is not a requirement 
for drivers when finished with the irq? because of shared interrupts?

Yeah, so since we use the devm irq request method, we also need a devm 
dispose release method as we can't dispose the irq mapping in the 
remove() method, prior to the irq_free() in the later devm release method.

But it looks like there is more to it than that, which I'm worried is 
far from non-trivial. For example, just calling irq_dispose_mapping() 
for removal and then plaform_get_irq()->acpi_get_irq() second time fails 
as it looks like more tidy-up is needed for removal...

Cheers,
John
