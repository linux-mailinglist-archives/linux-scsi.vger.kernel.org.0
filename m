I don't understand why you think this is an improvement over just
using an allocating XArray for all LUNs.  It seems like more code,
and doesn't actually save you any storage space ... ?

I appreciate you're implementing the API that's currently in use, but I would recommend open-coding this.  Looking at the functions called, lots of them
are two-three liners, eg:

static void __scsi_report_device_reset(struct scsi_device *sdev, void *data)
{
        sdev->was_reset = 1;
        sdev->expecting_cc_ua = 1;
}

which would just be more readable:

        if (rtn == SUCCESS) {
		struct scsi_target *starget = scsi_target(scmd->device);
		struct scsi_device *sdev;
		unsigned long index;

                spin_lock_irqsave(host->host_lock, flags);
		xa_for_each(&starget->devices, index, sdev) {
			sdev->was_reset = 1;
			sdev->expecting_cc_ua = 1;
		}
                spin_unlock_irqrestore(host->host_lock, flags);
        }

And then maybe you could make a convincing argument that the spin_lock
there could be turned into an xa_lock since that will prevent sdevs from
coming & going during the iteration of the device list.

Actually, I would say this is a great place to not use the host_lock.

...

+		err = xa_insert_irq(&starget->devices, sdev->lun_idx, sdev,

        spin_lock_irqsave(shost->host_lock, flags);
-       list_add_tail(&sdev->same_target_siblings, &starget->devices);
        list_add_tail(&sdev->siblings, &shost->__devices);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(shost->host_lock, flags);

Saving space in data structures, mostly.  It's not really useful to
have 4 billion things in an allocating XArray.  Indeed, it's not really
useful to have 4 billion of almost anything.  So we have XArrays which
are indexed by something sensible like page index in file, and they're
nice and well-behaved (most people don't create files in excess of 16TB,
and those who do don't expect amazing performance when seeking around
in them at random because they've lost all caching effects).  And then
you have people who probably want one scsi device.  Maybe a dozen.
Possibly a thousand.  Definitely not a million.  If you get 4 billion scsi
devices, something's gone very wrong.  You've run out of drive letters,
for a start (/dev/sdmzabcd anybody?)

It doesn't cost us anything to just use unsigned long as the index of an
XArray, due to how it's constructed.  Except in this one place where we
need to point to somewhere to store the index so that we can update the
index within an sdev before anybody iterating the data structure under
RCU can find the uninitialised index.

This patch seems decent enough ... I just think the decision to optimise
the layout for LUNs < 256 is a bit odd.  But hey, your subsystem,
not mine.
