dtb <-> kernel is an ABI and not an internal interface. The dts files
are hosted in the kernel for convenience as that's where the vast
majority of h/w support is. The DT parts are also generated as a
standalone repo[1] using git-filter-branch for other projects to use.

With the above being said, it's up to the individual platform
maintainers to decide whether breaking the ABI is okay or how long to
worry about compatibility. My only requirement is documenting that a
change does break compatibility. Given this is probably an optional
driver, they may not care.

BTW, we have broken (and fixed) 1998 era PowerMac G3s not too long
ago. That's the opposite direction with old DT (firmware really) and
new kernel.
