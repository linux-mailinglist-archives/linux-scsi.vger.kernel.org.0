I do not need the sessions under the tpgt dir and will drop it. The
target subsystem does not have a bus or use device structs at all right
now. And, I saw how other code that does not have a bus like btrfs/ext4
use kobject_create_and_add() to group/organize objects and went wild
with dirs :)

And, I can move the code to device structs, but had a question about the
deep tree question.

A common operation will be that userspace knows the names of the objects
above the session in the tree already. Apps then want to read in a
specific session or scan the specific sessions in a target or a tpgt.
The deep tree makes it easy to build the sysfs path and scan/read the
specific object/objects.

I wanted to avoid the issue where apps have with the flat layout where
they have to scan every session when they just want something specific.

Will a deep tree be ok for this type of reason?
