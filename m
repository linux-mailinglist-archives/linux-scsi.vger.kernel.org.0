 FYI I have now tracked down the cause of the regression, which is outside 
BusLogic code; specifically commit af73623f5f10 ("[SCSI] sd: Reduce buffer 
size for vpd request").  It wasn't exactly easy as for an odd reason Linux 
versions ~3.15 through to ~4.5 usually crash with this system in early 
startup before anything is output to the serial console.

 I'm still working on a proper fix, but with said commit reverted the 
system boots and with your series applied it has survived system-wide fsck 
even, which happened to get scheduled.  So for BT-958:
