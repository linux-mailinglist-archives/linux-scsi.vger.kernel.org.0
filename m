Ah. That's interesting. I thought it is like that, but wasn't sure from
the spec. Thanks for clarifying.

I was worrying a bit whether this would create some hard to debug
problems in the wild, when QoS essentially depends on the order in which
Applications/Containers are started and get IDs assigned accordingly -
assuming there is multiple priority ranges.
