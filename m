For a bunch of reasons: IRQ number used to be created 1:1 with their
physical counterpart, so there wasn't a need to "get rid" of the
associated data structures. Also, people expected their drivers
to be there for the lifetime of the system (believe it or not,
hotplug devices are pretty new!).

Shared interrupts are just another part of the problem (although we
should be able to work out whether there is any action attached to
the descriptor before blowing it away.

Most probably. I could imagine things failing if there is any trace
of an existing translation in the ITS or in the platform-MSI layer,
for example, or if the interrupt is still active...

Thanks,
