Totally agree. I consider this patch just a hack and way to get the
discussion going, hence the RFC :) Well, maybe we are going to add it
downstream in our kernels until we have a better way for setting the
dev_loss_tmo.

As explained the debugfs interface is not working (okay, that's
something which could be fixed) and it has the big problem that it is
not under control by udevd. Not sure if we with some new udev rules the
debugfs could automatically discovered or not.

The lpfc driver does expose the FCP/SCSI and the FC-NVMe rports nicely
via the fc_remote_ports and this is what I would like to have from the
qla2xxx driver as well. qla2xxx exposes the FCP/SCSI rports but not the
FC-NVMe rports.

Thanks,
Daniel
