Hi,

I appreciate your insightful comments.

I will change to "JESD220-3 (HPB v1.0) proposes".
This patch supports HPB version 1.0.

We added UFS feature layer with several callbacks to important parts of the=
 UFS control flow.
Other extended features can also be implemented using the proposed APIs.
For example, in WB, "prep_fn" can be used to guarantee the lifetime of UFS =
by updating the amount of write IO used as WB.
And reset/reset_host/suspend/resume can be used to manage the kernel task f=
or checking lifetime of UFS.

There are no other public studies currently.
However, when using HPB, there is an internal report that read latency is i=
mproved in android=20
user-case scenarios, as well as in the benchmarks.
