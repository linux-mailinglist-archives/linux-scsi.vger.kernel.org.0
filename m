Yes it is one of the solutions. Once detect the UFS device is version 
3.0+, you can lower
the voltage to 2.5V from the hardcoded value used by the driver. 
However, to change the
Vcc voltage, the host needs to follow a sequence to ensure safe 
operations after Vcc change
(device has to be in sleep mode, Vcc needs to go down to 0 then up to 
2.5V.)
Also same sequence is repeated for every host initialization which is 
inconvenient.

Thank you for the suggestion.
