That is my preference and I wanted to say that. But it is not an =

requirement.

It is always good to not break existing behavior and I also thought =
about
that. But there are also other, maybe conflicting, aspects, like =
simplification
of code paths and not to provide surprises to those who have not yet
experienced the quirks.

Either behavior is OK for me.

st_ioctl() has grown a very long time: small bits of code have been
added time after time. One strong motive has been to limit the
testing effort. This is why I nowadays try to look for opportunities
to safe simplification and clarification of the code when something
has to be changed :-)

Thanks, Kai
