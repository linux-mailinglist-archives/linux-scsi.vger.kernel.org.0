A summary of my concerns is as follows:
* The current I/O priority levels (RT, BE, IDLE) apply to all block 
devices. IOPRIO_CLASS_DL is only supported by certain block devices 
(some but not all SCSI harddisks). This forces applications to check the 
capabilities of the storage device before it can be decided whether or 
not IOPRIO_CLASS_DL can be used. This is not something applications 
should do but something the kernel should do. Additionally, if multiple 
dm devices are stacked on top of the block device driver, like in 
Android, it becomes even more cumbersome to check whether or not the 
block device supports CDL.
* For the RT, BE and IDLE classes, it is well defined which priority 
number represents a high priority and which priority number represents a 
low priority. For CDL, only the drive knows the priority details. I 
think that application software should be able to select a DL priority 
without having to read the CDL configuration first.

I hope that I have it made it clear that I think that the proposed user 
space API will be very painful to use for application developers.

Bart.
