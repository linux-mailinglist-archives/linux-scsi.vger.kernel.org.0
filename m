My bad, yes, io_uring does not work reliably for zoned writes because of its
no-wait handling of BIOs and punting to a worker thread for blocking BIOs. But
as I said, tests with libaio did not go well either.

So the end result of your patches is that the submission path can still
generates reordering and cause unaligned write errors. Not great to say the
least. I would really prefer something that does not cause such submission
errors to be sure that if we see an error, it is due to the a user bug (user
sending unaligned writes).
