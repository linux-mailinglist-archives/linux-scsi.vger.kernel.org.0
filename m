Hello Martin, James, linux-scsi folks,

some time ago we noticed - Fedor did - that our DIV and DIX support in
zfcp broke at some point. I tracked that down to a commit made for v5.4
(737eb78e82d5), but we didn't notice it back than, because our CI
doesn't currently run with either DIV, nor DIX enabled (time allowing
this is something we want to improve so we catch stuff like this
earlier). It also turned out that the commit in v5.4 was not really the
root-cause, and was only making the problem visible more easy.

I wrote a rather verbose description/analysis of the problem in patch 8.

In short: zfcp used to allocate/add the shost object for a HBA before
knowing all the HBA's capabilities, and we later patched the shost
object to make more of the capabilities known - including the protection
capabilities. Back when we still had the old blk queue, this worked
fine; after scsi_mod switched to blk-mq and because requests are now
all allocated during allocation time of the blk-mq tag-set, this doesn't
work anymore. Changes we make later to the protection capabilities don't
get reflected into the tag-set's requests, and they are missing parts.
When we then try to send I/O, scsi_mod tries to access the protection
payload data, who are not there, and it crashes the kernel.
    So instead, I now want to allocate/add the shost object for a HBA
after we know all of its base capabilities. This solves the
bug.
    For more details, please see patch 8.

I guess one could say this is a regression, but after thinking about it
for a bit I thought its reasonable to assume that zfcp behaves rather
different here than other drivers, because no one else seems to have
this issue, and so I tried to fix it in zfcp - also with the thought
that this hopefully reduces the risk of further such regressions in the
future.

Because we had this modus operandi for a very long time, I had to touch
many places that assume the shost object was already allocated -
explaining the rather big patchset for a 'fix'. Patches 1 to 7 are
preparations that fix all those places, so we don't access invalid
memory, and we don't loose any information during the HBA
initialization. Patch 8 finally moves the shost object allocation/add.


I assume we can't have this in stable, because the new code depends on a
feature from v5.5 that won't be in all release that would need this
fix... making it rather complicated. Its also too big for stable I
assume.


I tested this extensively internally to hopefully catch any bugs, so far
I have not seen any. I ran our regression-suite with DIV/DIX/NONE; with
I/O, and local/remote cable pulls, switched and p-t-p. Additionally I
had some inject running that would make early initialization fail in
places where we usually already had the shost object allocated; and I
made the shost object allocation/add fail; to see we don't crash, and
can recovery fine once the injects are turned off.


The patches apply fine on both Martin's `5.7/scsi-fixes`, and James'
`fixes` branches. It would be great if you could still get them into 5.7
somehow, but I realise its late in the cycle, and the series might be
too big at this point.


Any comments and reviews are appreciated :)
