Thanks Daniel for the report and your effort here. Agree, this needs to be 
fixed.

If you do not mind, can I take this from here? This touches quite a 
number of paths, and I would like to have this go through a full 
regression cycle before this is merged.

That said, I had some general comments:

1. I see sp->lock was introduced, but could not locate where it was used.
2. I did not see a release of lock after a successful kref_put_lock, maybe 
   that piece was missed out.
3. The sp->done should be invoked only once, and I do not see if this is
   taken care of.
4. sp->cmd_sp could be a SCSI IO too, where sp is not allocated 
   separately, so qla2x00_sp_release shall not be called for it.

Regards,
-Arun
