Hi Martin,

We are working on adding bsg interface support in mpi3mr driver. In
bsg, we can use SG_IO command type for synchronous ioctls,
but I don't see the infrastructure for asynchronous commands. I
searched a bit around it and noticed that "poll" interface was
supported
earlier but removed through this patch-
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg2853766.html

We have a requirement wherein the userland application/daemon
waits/listens for asynchronous driver/firmware events.
With driver IOCTLs, we were using the "fasync" interface for this. How
can we achieve the same with bsg interface ?

Thanks,
Sumit
