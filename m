If gcc is now warning about zero length members, why isn't it warning
about this one ... are unions temporarily excluded?

Let's go back to what the standard says:  we want the data beyond the
ssp_response_iu to be addressable either as sense_data if it's an error
return or resp_data if it's a real response.  What about trying to use
an alias attribute inside the structure ... will that work on gcc-10?
