Well, it's a layering problem: if all queues should be stopped on
shutdown, then this should be done from block (for all queues including
those outside SCSI).

device_shutdown() goes in reverse devices_kset->list order, so it looks
like it would do the PCI device then the SCSI device then the ULD then
block, so we can use the queues in SCSI for emergency actions (like
flush or stop) before block goes down.  Although this isn't guaranteed;
there are things, like device_link_add, which reorder this kset, so
we'd need to make sure the above assumption is correct.
