I don't think that matters.

Maybe someone from the linux-scsi mailing list will help.

Here is the problem we are facing, as shown in the following debugging 
log.  The log includes a sequence of six commands sent to a DVD drive.  
The first READ succeeds:

May 28 14:03:05 watership kernel: *** thread awakened

May 28 14:03:05 watership kernel: *** thread sleeping

The second READ hangs for 30 seconds (reason unknown) and then gets 
aborted.  Following the abort, usb-storage automatically performs a 
reset:

Next is a GET EVENT/STATUS NOTIFICATION...

... followed by a retry attempt of the previous READ, which hangs and is 
aborted again:

May 28 14:03:37 watership kernel: *** thread awakened
May 28 14:03:37 watership kernel: Command READ_10 (10 bytes)

May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: scsi command aborted
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: *** thread sleeping

Then there's another successful GET EVENT/STATUS NOTIFICATION:

May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: *** thread awakened
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: Command GET EVENT/STATUS NOTIFICATION (10 bytes)

May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: scsi cmd done, result=0x0
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: *** thread sleeping

And a third attempt at the READ, which hangs as before:

May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: *** thread awakened
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: Command READ_10 (10 bytes)
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: bytes: 28 00 00 3e 38 00 00 00 02 00
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: Bulk Command S 0x43425355 T 0x227 L 4096 F 128 Trg 0 LUN 0 CL 10
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: xfer 31 bytes
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: Status code 0; transferred 31/31
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: -- transfer complete
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: Bulk command transfer result=0
May 28 14:04:08 watership kernel: xfer 4096 bytes, 1 entries

But this time, instead of aborting the command, the SCSI core calls the 
device_reset routine.  This causes usb-storage to lock up; the reset 
can't proceed while the READ command is still executing:

May 28 14:04:38 watership kernel: device_reset called

So here's the question: Why doesn't the SCSI error handler abort the 
ongoing command (like it did the first two times) before resetting the 
device?

Note: The kernel version is 5.7-rc7.
