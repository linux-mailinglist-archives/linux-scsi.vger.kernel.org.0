Hi Mike,

Although I'm not sure that I completely understood the above: my goal 
with this patch is to make sure that all activity on the host tag set 
has stopped by the time scsi_forget_host() returns. I do not only want 
to cover the case where scsi_remove_host() is called by the ib_srp 
driver but also the case where a SCSI device that was created by the 
ib_srp driver is removed before scsi_remove_host() is called. Users can 
trigger this scenario by writing into /sys/class/scsi_device/*/*/delete.

Adding a new callback into scsi_host_dev_release() would not help 
because the scsi_host_dev_release() call may happen long after 
scsi_forget_host() returned.

Does this answer your question?

Bart.
