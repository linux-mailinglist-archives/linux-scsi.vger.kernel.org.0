Hi John,

Most of the time user space applications are not sensitive to libsas(or 
libata) "internal" commands. The applications only need the kernel 
response quickly on their "read" or "write" syscalls. This patch aborts 
all the application's IO and they will return immediately. We have 
tested this patch for more than 300 times. The "internal" commands may 
affects the EH process but in out test it does not affect the 
application's IO return.

This is great. After your series we can manage "internal" commands more 
effectively, I think. And we can easily control all the commands 
including the "internal" commands.

Yes, It does nothing now for expanders. I can filter out the expander 
devices in advance to avoid the wasting tag itering.

This device has not been initialized completely if "never saw 
sas_rphy_add", and there will be no IO from the block layer. I think 
there is no real bug but we need to avoid to iter the tag set too.

Thanks,
Jason
