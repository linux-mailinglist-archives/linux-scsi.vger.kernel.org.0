The issue it creates is the opposite of that: it breaks the desired spin
down.  After some period of inactivity, the disk should be suspended,
but after a system resume, the kernel thinks that it already is, and so
won't suspend it again.

I tested this last week and it appeared to work.  I enabled runtime pm
on the disk, as well as the ata port, and as soon as the disk suspended,
the port did as well.

Right, I would rather the disk stay asleep if it has PuiS enabled, and
I'm working on a patch for that.  In the process of doing that though, I
noticed that despite waking the disk up, it does not inform runtime pm
about that.

Again, it seems to me that the child reference counting IS working.

Probably nobody is using it yes, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try
to get it working.  It would be nice to have the drive go into deep
SLEEP instead of standby, as well as suspend the ata port, and possibly
even the whole AHCI controller rather than relying on the old APM drive
internal auto standby mode.
