Rather that simply consuming UAs, what do you think of a fixed length
FIFO, say 8 entries, that holds the asc,ascq of the last 8 UAs together
with a timestamp of when it was received (with a boot time epoch).
Then allow the user space to see that FIFO via sysfs (e.g. under
/sys/class/scsi_device/<hctl>). Remembering the previous UA may also be
useful for the mid-level UA processing. For example after a firmware
upgrade, there may be UAs for both INQUIRY data change and device reset.

Also the first device reset after a reboot (power cycle) is expected,
having one later, for example when part of a disk is mounted, is a bit
more suspicious.
