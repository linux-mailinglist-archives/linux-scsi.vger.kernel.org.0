If it were so easy.
The biggest problem we're facing in SCSI EH is that basically _all_ 
instances I've seen where EH got engaged were due to a command timeout.

Which means that we've sent a command to the HBA, and never heard from 
it again. Now, it were easy if it would just be the command which has 
vanished, but the problem is that we don't know what happened.
It might be the command being ln transit, the drive might be 
unresponsive, or the HBA has gone off the rails altogether.
So until we've established where the command got lost, we have to assume 
the worst and _have_ to treat the HBA as unreliable.
So initially we shouldn't isolate the device, and hope the failure is 
restricted to the device.
Instead we have to stop I/O to the HBA, establish communication 
(typically by sending a TMF), and only restart operations once we get a 
response back from the HBA.

This is especially true for old SCSI parallel HBA, where quite some 
state is being kept in the HBA structure itself. So if we were to send 
another command we would loas the state of the failed command, and 
wouldn't be able to figure out the root cause on why the command had failed.

Cheers,

Hannes
