Quiesce was a specific invention for SPI Domain Validation.  That's
where you try a specific set of patterns to the buffer and read them
back and try to jack up the transport parameters.  Pretty much every
transport does this type of retraining, but on all but SPI it's usually
hidden in hardware.

The point is you need to be able to stop all other I/O and then send
READ/WRITE_BUFFER commands to the device.

As long as the SPI transport class exists, there'll be a distinction.
I'm not sure there's a use for quiesce beyond that.

The SPI transport class would break.
