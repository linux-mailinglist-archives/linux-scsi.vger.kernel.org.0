I was not part of this conversation, but as I see it each approach give
a benefit. QEMU is fantastic for compliance testing and I am not sure
you get the same level of command analysis anywhere else; at least not
without writing dedicated code for this in a target.

This said, when we want to test for race conditions, QEMU is very slow.
For a software-only solution, we have experimented with something
similar to the nvme-debug code tha Mikulas is proposing. Adam pointed to
the nvme-loop target as an alternative and this seems to work pretty
nicely. I do not believe there should be many changes to support copy
offload using this.

So in my view having both is not replication and it gives more
flexibility for validation, which I believe it is always good.
