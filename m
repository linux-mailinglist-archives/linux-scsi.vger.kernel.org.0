Hi Matthew,

Thank you for proposing this topic. I would also like to be part of
this discussion at LSF/MM specifically because of the memory
efficiency opportunities coming of memdescs.

Interesting, given that pcp are mostly allocated by kmalloc and use
vmalloc for large allocations, how memdesc can be different for them
compared to regular kmalloc allocations given that they are sub-page?

There are many more drivers that would need the conversion. For
example, IOMMU page tables can occupy gigabytes of space, have
different implementations for AMD, X86, and several ARMs. Conversion
to memdesc and unifying the IO page table management implementation
for these platforms would be beneficial.
