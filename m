Great, I'll remove the driver support for "dev_ref_clk_ctrl" then.  However,
that doesn't solve the problem of the new DTS breaking old drivers, since old
drivers assume that reg[1] is dev_ref_clk_ctrl.

This patch makes the DTS look like:

	reg = <0 0x01d84000 0 0x2500>,
	      <0 0x01d90000 0 0x8000>;
	reg-names = "std", "ice";

The "ice" registers are new and are accessed by name instead of by index.

But these also happen to be in reg[1].  Old drivers will see that reg[1] is
present and assume it is dev_ref_clk_ctrl.

To work around this, I could leave a blank reg[1] entry:

	reg = <0 0x01d84000 0 0x2500>,
	      <0 0 0 0>,
	      <0 0x01d90000 0 0x8000>;
	reg-names = "std", "dev_ref_clk_ctrl", "ice";

Do I need to do that?
