I wasn't meaning to send the INQUIRY regardless to what the page says,
if it is present. I was just thinking to having fall-back for when the
page 0 is not there at all (initially, when you call
`rcu_dereference()`). That would support your storage, as you have page
0, and it would be present for the check I assume.

But anyway, it seems this is a no-go regardless. I didn't expect targets
sending a valid page 0, but still supporting pages that are not listed in it.
