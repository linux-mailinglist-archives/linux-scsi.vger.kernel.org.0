I don't quite actually follow your fix here and I didn't test the 
similar
fault injection scenario like you do here, so I am not sure if I should
just absorb your fix into mine. How about I put my fix in my current 
error
recovery patch series (maybe in next version of it) and you can give 
your
review. So you can still go with your fix as it is. Mine will be picked 
up
later by Martin. What do you think?

Thanks,

Can Guo.
