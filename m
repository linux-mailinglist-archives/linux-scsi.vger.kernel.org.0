Subject: [PATCH] scsi: add expecting_media_change flag to error path
Date:   Mon, 24 Aug 2020 21:04:00 +0200

SD Cardreaders (especially) sometimes lose the state during suspend
and deliver a "media changed" unit attention when really only a
(runtime) suspend/resume cycle has been done.

Add a flag for drivers to use when this is expected. It's handled in the
scsi core error path and allows to use (runtime) PM when it has
no been possible before on said hardware.

The "downside" is that we rely more on users not to really change
the medium (SD card) *during* a simple suspend/resume, i.e. when not
unmounting.

How to *use* this flag remains an open problem but for testing (if you
get "media changed" UA errors when runtime PM enabled as described below),
simply do to /drivers/scsi/sd.c

To enable runtime PM for SD cardreader (here, device number 0:0:0:0),
do the following:

echo 0 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs
echo 1000 > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/0:0:0:0/power/autosuspend_delay_ms
echo auto > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/0:0:0:0/power/control

If you don't want to merge a flag without any user, I understand that
but we can add a user (sysfs setting to opt-in?) once we agree on
what it does, right?

Since this patch solves my specific problem, I'd appreciate any more
feedback and hope we can find a solution that works for everyone.

thanks a lot,
