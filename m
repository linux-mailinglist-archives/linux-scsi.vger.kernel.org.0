Hi Damien,

jfyi, I still see the hang with this series. I don't think that the tag 
fixes were relevant unfortunately.

btw, how about add guys from get_maintainers.pl to lighten the review 
workload (and we should have the official maintainer anyway)? There are 
quite a few patches now...

Thanks,
John
