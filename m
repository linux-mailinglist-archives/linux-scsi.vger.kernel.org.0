Hi Jens,

How about the following approach?
* Remove CONFIG_BLK_SUB_PAGE_SEGMENTS.
* Use the static key mechanism instead of #ifdef
   CONFIG_BLK_SUB_PAGE_SEGMENTS to prevent that this patch series makes
   the hot path in the block layer slower.
* Count the number of request queues that need support for segments
   smaller than a page or max_hw_sector values smaller than
   PAGE_SIZE >> SECTOR_SHIFT. If that number changes from zero to one,
   enable the code introduced by this patch series. If that number drops
   to zero, toggle the static key such that the overhead of the code that
   supports small segments is eliminated.

One of the functions modified by this patch series is 
blk_rq_append_bio(). That function is called by code that builds a bio 
(e.g. filesystems). Code that builds a bio does not call any block 
driver code. This is why I think it would be hard to move the 
functionality introduced by this patch series into block drivers.

Thanks,

Bart.
