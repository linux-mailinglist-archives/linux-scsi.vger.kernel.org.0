I don't know there are such MQ HBA driver in tree, at least that is the
current blk-mq/scsi-mq model: each hw queue has its own independent
tags, so there can't be the limit for MQ HBA, which should allow to
accept (.can_queue * nr_hw_queues) commands. And I did hear people
complains bad performance caused by the atomic .host_busy counter.

If you are talking about the current SQ(from blk-mq or scsi-mq viewpoint) H=
BA
which has multiple reply queue(HPSA, hisilicon SAS, mpt3sas, and megaraid_s=
as),
they are just the special type. According to scsi-mq's model, they should
belong to SQ HBA.

As I mentioned above, that is current blk-mq/scsi-mq's model, each hw
queue has its own independent tags, so the check really doesn't make
sense.

No, just the small number of special type SCSI HBAs with multiple reply que=
ue
and single tags can't benefit from the patchset of 'improve blk-mq for CPU =
hotplug',
and all other normal MQ device/drivers do get improved wrt. CPU hotplug.

We have tried hosttags approach for the several drivers, but looks it is
too messy. Given there are only 3 or 4 such device, we still can improve
them via driver private approach in future if no generic way is doable.=20
