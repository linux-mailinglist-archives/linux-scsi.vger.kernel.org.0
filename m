Thank you for clarification!

Should I close my bugreport when Bjorn's "Qualcomm UFS device reset support" series will hit upstream, or I should wait for additional fix that applicable for ACPI boot as well?  

I don't know if this boot delay is Ok for generic installer image, and it's not up to me to decide this, which is why I ask.
