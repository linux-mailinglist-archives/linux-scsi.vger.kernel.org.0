Yes. But the important thing to remember is that with 'zone append' the 
resulting LBA will be returned on completion, they will _not_ be 
specified in the submission. So any command reordering doesn't affect 
the zone append commands as they heven't been written yet.

Again, reordering is not an issue with zone append. With zone append you 
specify in which zone the command should land, and upon completion the 
LBA where the data is written will be returned.

So if there is an error the command has not been written, consequently 
there is no LBA to worry about, and you can reorder at will.

Cheers,

Hannes
