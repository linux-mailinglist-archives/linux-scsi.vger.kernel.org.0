Right, that is exactly what we are discussing, one instance of
blk_mq_hw_ctx, and lots of reply queue, each reply queue is mapped to
one MSI-X vector.

PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY guarantees that all possible CPUs are covered no matter
how many MSI-X vectors there are.

The genirq code supposes to handle the case well if there is at least
one CPU available for handling the managed IRQ.

However, if it can't, the approach I suggested can cover this case well,
given driver can drain any request, included internal commands which
is sent via the reply queue.

We still can solve the issue by exposing one submission queue(hctx) like the
current code.

Driver can drain requests in the introduced callback of .prep_queue_dead().

I remember that the performance won't be good from your initial test
on this way.

I am just wondering how both lpfc or qla2xx share the hostwide tags
among all hctxs, given not see such code in blk-mq, could you explain
it a bit?

Why? If there is CPU alive for the queue, the queue should work for
that CPU. 

Also if there is one CPU alive for the queue, you can't quiesce the
queue easily, given we have to allow the alive CPU to submit IO.

Also we can't use queue freeze in CPU hotplug handler, that may cause queue
dependency issue.

That depends if all drivers can avoid to send internal command via managed IRQ,
at least now, almost all hpsa, mpt3sas and hisi_sas may do that, cause
the reply queue is selected simply by passing 'raw_processor_id()'.

I am not sure if private tags can help on this issue, what we need to do
is to drain and in-flight requests(internal or io) from one reply queue(
MSI-X vector). That means private tags still have to deal with the reply
queue mapping.
