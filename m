Xfstests btrfs/003 uses the SCSI sysfs interface to emulate missing block device. We can use any SCSI devices to run the test case, so we cannot use target configfs here.

Even the end result of missing "/dev/sd?" is the same, they are two distinct interfaces. So, we need to fix the broken result of the SCSI sysfs interface anyway?

Hm, taking look at the code (target_fabric_make_lun), there is no upper limit check there. So, set max_lun = U64_MAX right?
I once considered that but when I create LUN larger than 65535, "targetcli ls" died complaining "LUN must be 0 to 65535". So I used 65536 here.

Or, should we use max_lun = U64_MAX and fix userland side? They need to be the same, anyway, I believe...

Ah, I didn't notice that point. I'll address that and send a new version.
