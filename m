Get thee to a nunnery! [W. Shakespeare; translation: "fuck off"]
Now that is imperative.

As for "imperative mood", I believe there is no such thing in English
grammar. My mother taught grammar and I studied French and Latin at
school. Markus Elfring objected to my:
     [PATCH] lib/scatterlist: Fix memory leak in sgl_alloc_order()  ***

with the same "imperative mood" line. In English, including British
(i.e. "international") English taught in south Asia, that is the
_imperative_ . Basically if you can stick "You" in front of the
verb at the start of the sentence and the sense is the same, then
it is the imperative.

Is the "imperative mood" something in Danish or German grammar?
