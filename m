Hi Himanshu,

I've tried the patch and it seems that LOGO doesn't succeed yet:
[ 1079.073246] qla2xxx [0000:00:06.0]-2870:1: Async-logout - hdl=0 loop-id=0 portid=000002 21:00:00:24:ff:7f:35:c6.
[ 1079.073333] qla2xxx [0000:00:06.0]-5837:1: Async-logout failed - 21:00:00:24:ff:7f:35:c6 hdl=12 portid=000002 comp=31 iop0=19 iop1=c.

It means that firmware detected IOCB parameter error at offset 0xc.
I'll examine IOCB parameter dumps tomorrow.

Are you ok if I send the patch (keeping Quinn's authorship) in the my
patch set once I get it fixed?

I also consider to add one more patch to address the issue with BA_RJT.
The idea is to discard a frame that has no session (not logged in) and
send explicit LOGO ELS instead of BA_RJT to follow FCP spec 12.3.3:
   When an ABTS-LS is received at the target FCP_Port, it shall abort
   the designated Exchange and return one of the following responses:

   a) the target FCP_Port shall discard the ABTS-LS and transmit a LOGO
      ELS if the Nx_Port issuing the ABTS-LS is not currently logged in
      (i.e., no N_Port Login exists);

Although, I don't know if firmware can handle that yet. We'll see.

Thank you,
Roman
