I was curious what you hit, but yes rq_qos_exit is obvious.
blk_flush_integrity also is very much about fs I/O state.

something like that.  I think we need to split the dying flag into
one for the gendisk and one for the queue first, and make sure the
queue freeze in del_gendisk is released again so that passthrough
still works after.

Yes.
