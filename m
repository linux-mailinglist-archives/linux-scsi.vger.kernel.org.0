Other than UIC cmds, I can only think of device manangement cmds (like 
query).
If device management cmds come into the way in the future, we fix it as 
well.
I mean that is the right thing to do in my opinion - just like we don't 
call
pm_runtime_get_sync() in ufshcd_send_uic_cmd().

I can understand that you want a simple/quick fix to get it work for you 
once
for all, but from my point of view, debugging clk gating/ungating really 
takes
huge efforts sometime (I've spent a lot of time on it). Some flash 
vendors also
use it in their own driver widely which makes some failure scenes even 
harder to
undertand/debug. So the first thing comes to my head is that we should 
avoid
making it more complex or giving it more exceptions.

 From functionality point of view, it looks ok to me. It is just that I 
cannot
predict it won't cause new problems since the clk gating/ungating 
sequeces are
like magic in some use cases sometime.

Thanks,

Can Guo.
