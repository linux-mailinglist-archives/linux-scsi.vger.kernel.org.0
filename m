I'm not sure what you mean by heavy footprint on the initiator part means.

I would say do whatever is helpful to you to debug the problem. For
TCM_WRITE_PROTECTED I'm not sure the initiatorname is helpful. I think
the target name and tpg would be useful, because I think you sometimes
set it at the tpg level then it gets inherited by the LU. But I think
it's a pain to get to the target name from this code path, so I wouldn't
worry about adding it now.

Just to make sure we are on the same page. I was just commenting about
the other NON_EXISTENT_LUN instace in transport_lookup_tmr_lun. I just
thought we would want/need the same info there.
