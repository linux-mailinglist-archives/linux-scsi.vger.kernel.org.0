--- Comment #53 from Paul Ausbeck (paula@alumni.cse.ucsc.edu) ---
I sense that we are in disagreement. In my way of thinking disagreement is
overcome through logical argument. So here goes.

I argue that you can't call a bug fixed if the fix introduces a serious,
entirely separate, regression. I further argue that at resume the mouse poi=
nter
should be interactive at the same time that the display becomes active. I
further argue that if the mouse pointer is not interactive at any time that=
 the
display is active, that is a serious UX bug. I further argue that before the
recent kernel ATA changes this particular bug did not exist and therefore i=
t is
a regression. I further argue that though the regression is UX related it
cannot be patched over outside of the kernel. I further argue that this
regression likely affects any personal machine that contains a spinning disk
and that this class of machines is substantial in size. I further argue that
your reported deadlock between ata resume and scsi resume likely affects a =
far
smaller class of machines. I further argue that though for a single machine
deadlock is a more important problem than temporary lack of mouse pointer
interactivity, for the kernel as a whole, problem importance is proportiona=
l to
the multiplication of the individual seriousness and the size of the set of
affected machines. I further argue that your assertion that the non-interac=
tive
mouse pointer is not related to the libata resume changes is incorrect. I
further argue that the two dmesg fragments that I have posted to this thread
explain the situation quite clearly.

My argument contains 10 assertions. If you disagree with any of them, please
give details. In particular I don't have a clear idea of the size of the se=
t of
machines that might experience the "fixed" ata/scsi resume deadlock.
