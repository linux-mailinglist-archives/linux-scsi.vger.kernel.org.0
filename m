And indeed, that would be the easiest consumer.
One 'just' needs to have a simple script converting the sysfs ranges
into the corresponding dm-linear table definitions, and create one DM
device for each range.
That would simulate the multi-LUN approach.
Not sure if that would warrant a 'real' DM target, seeing that it's
fully scriptable.

Rumours have it that Paolo Valente is working on adapting BFQ to utilize
the range information for better actuator utilisation.
And eventually one should modify filesystem utilities like xfs to adapt
the metadata layout to multi-actuator drives.

The _real_ fun starts once the HDD manufactures starts putting out
multi-actuator SMR drives :-)
