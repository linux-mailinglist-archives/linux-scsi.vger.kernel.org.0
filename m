I'm working on the rm_all_hosts parameter angle which lets me get in "under"
modprobe, as well as after scsi_debug_init() finishes ... lots of races :-)

If I can solve all of those, the reported problem may disappear.

The scsi_debug driver, being a low level driver (LLD) doesn't have that sort
of overview. It just sees a thundering heard of SCSI commands (e.g. REPORT
LUNS,
INQUIRY, TEST UNIT READY, then READ CAPACITY) followed by READs. It doesn't
know or care where they come from or what they are associated with.

After rm_all_hosts gets set, no further hosts are added, new commands get
rejected with DID_NO_CONNECT and queued commands have their timers cancelled
(if they are using a timer) and DID_NO_CONNECT is sent back to the mid-level
via their 'done' callback.

Yes, it does appear pretty early, with my script firing every 0.3 second
( 'echo 1 > rm_all_hosts') my modprobe scsi_debug creating 3 hosts gets
reliably hit after it has set up 1 of the 3 hosts.

After the system settles (with no hosts available) I want:
    echo 0 > rm_all_hosts
to recreate the host set up that would have been in place after an
un-interrupted modprobe (with the same parameters).


There is another curious thing that I am seeing when hosts are recreated:
the new devices (disks) have sg nodes but no sd nodes. That is with
lk 5.12.0-rc1 (MKP's 5.13/scsi-queue branch). The sd node resolution seems
to stop after a Power-on or device reset occurred UA. I notice that the sd
driver doesn't accept 0x29,0x1 which is "Power on occurred" in the same way.

I refer the sd maintainer to sam6r07.pdf section 5.14:

Each logical unit shall establish a unit attention condition when an I_T
nexus is established that has not been previously established. The
additional sense code shall be set to:
     a) POWER ON, RESET, OR BUS DEVICE RESET OCCURRED;
     b) DEVICE INTERNAL RESET; or
     c) POWER ON OCCURRED.


I was thinking of changing the scsi_debug driver to give 'c)' in the newly
created device case and 'a)' in the reset case(s).
