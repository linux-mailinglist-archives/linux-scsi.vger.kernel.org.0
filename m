OK, so the device will ignore the pre-request if it isn't received in
time, not sure it is common or not, since blk_execute_rq_nowait()
doesn't provide any feedback. Here looks blk_insert_cloned_request()
is better.

If you mean blk-mq timeout code will be triggered, I think it won't.
Meantime, LLD may see nothing to timeout too.

For example, in case of none io sched, the queue depth is 128, and 128 READ
IOs are sent to ufshcd_queuecommand() at the same time, and all these 128 IOs
require to allocate pre-request, but no one can move on because 128 tags are
used up.

So no request can be sent to device and BLK_STS_RESOURCE is always returned
from ufshcd_queuecommand(), also when blk-mq timeout is triggered, all in-flight
request's state may just be updated as IDLE, so blk-mq may find nothing to expire.

In case of real io scheduler, request->tag is released when BLK_STS_RESOURCE
is returned from ufshcd_queuecommand(), but it doesn't mean that
pre-request can get tag always.

The approach[1] of reserving one slot for pre-request should provide
forward progress guarantee.
