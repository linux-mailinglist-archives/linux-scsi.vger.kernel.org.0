Just to understand it correctly: 45235022da99 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix
driver unload by shutting down chip") is saying FW is not able to
shutdown propably and therefore we kill it first and still try to do
some cleanup.

Are you sure you got all the necessary places fixed up?

I tend to say we should add

	if (!ha->flags.fw_started)
		return QLA_FUNCTION_FAILED;

do qla2x00_mailbox_command() and handle the errors one by one. Just an
idea.

Thanks,
Daniel
