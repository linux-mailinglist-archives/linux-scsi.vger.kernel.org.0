Subject: [PATCH] docs: ABI: sysfs-driver-ufs: Add DeepSleep power mode
Date:   Fri,  6 Nov 2020 17:36:15 +0200

X-Mailing-List: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org

A patch for DeepSleep is in the scsi queue, but as per mkp:

	I left out the sysfs ABI piece due to the conflicts.
	I suggest you send that piece through the doc tree.

Ergo this patch.
