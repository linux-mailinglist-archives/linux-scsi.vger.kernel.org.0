This is indeed a tricky question.  It seems like we should allow a 
runtime resume to succeed if the only reason it failed was that the 
device has been removed.

More generally, perhaps we should always consider that a runtime 
resume succeeds.  Any remaining problems will be dealt with by the 
device's driver and subsystem once the device is marked as 
runtime-active again.

Suppose you try changing blk_post_runtime_resume() so that it always 
calls blk_set_runtime_active() regardless of the value of err.  Does 
that fix the problem?

And more importantly, will it cause any other problems...?
