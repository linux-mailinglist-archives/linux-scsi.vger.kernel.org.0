I don't think so.

There's some other uses of >>> in that file, eg about line 162:

  >>> The current powerpc implementation assumes that a device driver will
  >>> *not* schedule or semaphore in this routine; the current powerpc
  >>> implementation uses one kernel thread to notify all devices;
  >>> thus, if one device sleeps/schedules, all devices are affected.

So it's just an odd choice of emphasis device I think.
