I would also add that this seems to be arse backwards.  If the
intention is to have a high fidelity drive that always verifies writes,
why not simply add a verify after every write in the firmware before
completing the write?  Even if you send a MISCOMPARE sense code back,
we'll simply take it as write failure.  If you do this in Firmware, the
drive does what you want and is automatically supported by every
current SCSI stack without modification (well there might be some where
you'll have to give a failure sense code that WRITE would expect
instead of MISCOMPARE).

Regards,

James
