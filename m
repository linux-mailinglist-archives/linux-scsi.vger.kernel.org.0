Hello My Dear,

 I am sending the same message to you. My names are Mrs. Donna Louise
McInnes, a widow diagnosed with brain tumor disease which has gotten
to a very bad stage, Please I want you to understand the most
important reason why I am contacting you through this medium is
because I need your sincerity and ability to carry out this
transaction and fulfill my final wish in implementing the charitable
investment project in your country as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure, which i believe that you will not expose
this to anyone or betray this trust and confident that I am about to
entrust on you for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less
privileges ones. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband,
the sum of ($ 11,000,000.00) deposited with the Bank. Having known my
present health condition, I decided to entrust this fund to you
believing that you will utilize it the way i am going to instruct
herein.
It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment
Manager/Partner with 35% percent of the total money for your effort in
handling the transaction, 5% percent for any expenses or processing
charges fee that will involve during this process while 60% of the
fund will be Invested into the charity project there in your country.
Therefore I am waiting for your prompt respond, if only you are
interested in this humanitarian project for further details of the
transaction and execution of this charitable project for the glory and
honor of God the merciful compassionate. Your urgent reply will be
appreciated.

God bless you.
Sincerely Sister in Christ Mrs. Donna Louise McInnes.
