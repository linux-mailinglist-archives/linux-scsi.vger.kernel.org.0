Yes, but to implement that you don't need any secure storage *at all*. 
If all the RPMB did was authenticate an incrementing counter, you could 
just store the <last timestamp, attempts remaining> tuple inside a blob 
of secure (encrypted and MACed) storage on any random Flash device, 
along with the counter value, and thus prevent rollbacks that way (some 
finer design points are needed to deal with power loss protection and 
ordering, but the theory holds).

Basically what I'm saying is that for security *guarantee* purposes, 
AFAICT the storage part of RPMB makes no difference. It is useful in 
practical implementations for various reasons, but if you think you can 
use that secure storage to provide security properties which you 
couldn't do otherwise, you are probably being misled. If you're trying 
to understand what having RPMB gets you over not having it, it helps if 
you ignore all the storage stuff and just view it as a single secure, 
increment-only counter.

But this is only enforced by software. If you do not have secure boot, 
you can just patch software to allow infinite tries without touching the 
RPMB. The RPMB doesn't check PINs for you, it doesn't even gate read 
access to data in any way. All it does is promise you cannot make the 
counter count down, or make the data stored within go back in time.

This is hot how security systems are designed though; you do not "plug 
holes", what you do is cover more attack scenarios, and you do that in 
the order from simplest to hardest.

If we are trying to crack the PIN on a device we have physical access 
to, the simplest and most effective attack is to just run your own 
software on the machine, extract whatever hash or material you need to 
validate PINs, and do it offline.

To protect against that, you first need to move the PIN checking into a 
trust domain where an attacker with physical access can't easily break 
in, which means secure boot.

*Then* the next simplest attack is a secure storage rollback attack, 
which is what I described in that blog post about iOS. And *now* it 
makes sense to start thinking about the RPMB.

But RPMB alone doesn't make any sense on a system without secure boot. 
It doesn't change anything; in both cases the simplest attack is to just 
run your own software.

If you're trying to protect against a "dumb" attack with a keyboard 
emulator that doesn't consider access to physical storage, then you 
don't need RPMB either; you can just put the PIN unlock counter in a 
random file.
