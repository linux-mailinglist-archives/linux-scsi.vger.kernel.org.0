I'm not so sure of that, for instance what makes you think I don't do
it in my own reviews?

It's a grammatical tick not an insult and seeing it as such would help
defuse the situation.  I know this is difficult; my own pet grammatical
foible is having to contain it when I see "avoid that" in a patch
subject, but I've managed (so far).

OK, we picked a code of conduct which is Anglo biased and doesn't take
into account the linguistic diversity of the community; the various
problems with the current code of conduct are why we have to have the
interpretation document.

The problem, as I see it, is that you're assuming malice where I
wouldn't, even if linguistic issues weren't a potential issue.

Is there, perhaps, some other deeper underlying issue for which this is
serving as a proxy?
