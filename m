I believe it makes sense to do extensive characterization to understand
how the host and device implementation behave. However, I do not believe
we will get far if the requirement is that any acceleration has to
outperform the legacy path under all circumstances and implementations.

At this moment in time, this is a feature very much targeted to
eliminating the extra read/write traffic generated by ZNS host GC.

This said, we do see the value in aligning with existing efforts to
offload copy under other use cases, so if you have a set of tests we can
run to speak the same language, we would be happy to take them and adapt
them to the fio extensions we have posted for testing this too.
