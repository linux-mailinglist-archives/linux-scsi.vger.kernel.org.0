Curious, which udev script does this today for FC SCSI?

In theory, the exsting fc nvmediscovery udev event has enough information 
to find out the right qla2xxx debugfs node and set dev_loss_tmo.

Given that FC NVME does not have sysfs hierarchy like FC SCSI, I see 
utility in making FC-NVME ports available via fc_remote_ports. If, though, 
a FC target port is dual protocol aware this would leave with only one 
knob to control both.

I think, going with fc_remote_ports is better than introducing one more 
way (like this patch) to set this.
