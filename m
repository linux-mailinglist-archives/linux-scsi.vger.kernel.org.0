But this misses my point. sbc5r01.pdf says this:

   "If the device server supports changing the block descriptor parameters
    by a MODE SELECT command and the number of logical blocks or the
    logical block length is changed, then the device server establishes
    a unit attention condition of:
       a) CAPACITY DATA HAS CHANGED as described in 4.10; and
       b) MODE PARAMETERS CHANGED as described in SPC-6.

My point is: if "the logical block length is changed" then the sd driver
can NOT reliably issue any IO commands (READ or WRITE) until it does a
READ CAPACITY command to find out whether the LB size has changed, and
if so, to what.

This "unaligned" usage seems to come from ZBC and first appeared in
SPC-4, ASC/ACSQ code [0x21,0x4]: "Unaligned WRITE command". It is
the only use of the word "unaligned" in SPC-4, SPC-5 and spc6r06.pdf
and it is not defined (in those documents) or in the SBC specs.
Surprisingly it is used, but not defined in zbc2r12.pdf .

To me "unaligned" means some sort of transport issue which this is
not ***. It simply means the WRITE was not issued with a starting
LBA which corresponded to that zone's write pointer. This is
for "sequential write required" (swr)zones. IMO the ASC message
should be akin to: "Sequential write requirement violated".

Until Linux utilities catch up with zoned disks, users of zoned
disks are going to see a lot of that "unaligned"  error! Currently
you can't partition a zoned disk because those utilities try to
WRITE shadow copies further out on the disk and violate the
write pointer settings of swr zones (then crash and burn).
You can create a BTR file system on a whole zoned disk (e.g. /dev/sdb)
but only if you have a recent enough btrfs-prog package ****. Any
Debian user caught in this bind, try using the binary Sid package at:
     https://packages.debian.org/sid/btrfs-progs


Life is a little easier fo ZBC/ZAC zoned disks which typically
start with conventional (normal random WRITE capable) zones (for 1%
of the available storage) before the swr zones commence. ZNS (for
NVMe) doesn't support conventional zones.

***  well where sd.c generated that "unaligned" error it was because
      it tried to READ one block at LBA 0 and thought it was 4096
      bytes long. It wasn't (due to a MODE SELECT) so it got back
      512 bytes. Is that an alignment error ??

**** building btrfs-prog from its github source is not a pleasant
      experience, IMO
