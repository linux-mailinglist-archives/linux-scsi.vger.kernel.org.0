Sure, attachments work, but better yet, if you can show the difference
in a few lines that is much nicer than having to dig through large
numbers of log files.

I do not understand what exactly you mean by "call udev dependencies".

udev is used to create symlinks and set user/group permissions on device
nodes in /dev/ which is created by devtmpfs.  What exactly is not
happening in your /dev/ with the move to a newer kernel?

Have you contacted the eudev developers to see if something different
needs to be set in your kernel when moving 4 years in kernel development
forward?  Are you sure you have all the correct config options enabled?

Why such a huge leap forward all at once, how about going from 4.4.y to
4.9.y and then 4.14.y and then 5.4.y?  That might help narrow things
down a bit easier.
