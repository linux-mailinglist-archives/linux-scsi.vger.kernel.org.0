If alua_prep_fn() got called, the path was considered usable at the
given point in time by dm-multipath. Most probably the reason was
simply that no error condition had occured on this path before ALUA
state switched to transitioning. I suppose this can happen if=A0storage
switches a PG consisting of multiple paths to TRANSITIONING. We get an
error on one path (sda, say), issue an RTPG, and receive the new ALUA
state for all paths of the PG. For all paths except sda, we'd just see
a switch to TRANSITIONING without a previous SCSI error.

With this patch, we'll dispatch I/O (usually an entire bunch) to these
paths despite seeing them in TRANSITIONING state. Eventually, when the
SCSI responses are received, this leads to path failures. If I/O
latencies are small, this happens after a few ms. In that case, the
goal of Brian's patch is not reached, because the time until path
failure would still be on the order of milliseconds. OTOH, if latencies
are high, it takes substantially longer for the kernel to realize that
the path is non-functional, while other, good paths may be idle.=A0I fail
to see the benefit.

Martin
