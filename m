The UFS driver does not issue device commands to the block layer.
blk_get_request() is used only to get a free slot.

It doesn't mix them.

Already has one (hba->cmd_queue), but as noted above, device commands
aren't issued to it at the moment - they are sent directly.

To avoid involving SCSI, since device commands aren't issued to the
block layer, the UFS driver could instead keep 1 slot for itself
(i.e. reduce the number of tags by one), and drop blk_get_request();
noting that currently only 1 device command is sent at a time due to
hba->dev_cmd.lock mutex.
