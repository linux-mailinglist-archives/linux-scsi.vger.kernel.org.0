I agree. Unfortunately, there's no logic in dm-multipath saying "I may
switch paths inside a PG, but I may not do PG failover".

For me the question is still whether trying to send I/O to the path
that is known not to be able to process it makes sense.=A0As noted
elsewhere, you patch just delays the BLK_STS_AGAIN by a few
milliseconds. You want to avoid a PG switch, and I second that, but IMO
that needs a different approach.

But this means that we should modify the logic not only in
alua_prep_fn() but also=A0for handling of NOT READY conditions, either in
alua_check_sense() or in scsi_io_completion_action().
I agree that this would make a lot of sense, perhaps more than trying
to implement a cleverer logic in dm-multipath as discussed between
Hannes and myself.

This is what we need to figure out first: Do we want to change the
logic in the multipath layer, making it somehow aware of the special
nature of "transitioning" state, or should we tune the retry logic in
the SCSI layer such that dm-multipath will "do the right thing"
automatically?
