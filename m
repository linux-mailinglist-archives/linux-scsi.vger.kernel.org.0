That's not going to help: removing blk_insert_cloned_request() is what
we need.

Well, precisely: it's an optimization.  It can be removed now and you
can work out how to add the code back without the problem API later. 
We're running critically short of time to fix this, so unless you have
a different proposal, it's either this hunk of code or the entire
driver.
