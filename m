On my system, I see:

cat /sys/class/ata_port/ata1/power/runtime_active_kids
0

and same for port 10 which is a PMP box with 3 drives. So it means that the
children will be ignored, which is wrong. Note that the corresponding scsi_host
device also shows 0. So to be safe with port runtime PM, we need to fix that
first. Otherwise, the port may end up being runtime suspended with running
drives still attached to it.

/sys/class/ata_port/ata1/power/control is set to "auto" by default.
