To come back to this statement, as I keep seeing it in odd places...

I have never said that the next LTS kernel would be 5.9, where did you
get that from?  I am pretty sure that Google is also not saying that
either.

Work to get the feature accepted properly, do not worry about cramming
anything into any kernel just because it might be a LTS release.  That
causes problems that we have had in the past, and one would hope that we
would have learned from our mistakes.
