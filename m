The problem with this is that ATA disks normally spin up on their own
after system resume.  As a result, if the disk was put to sleep with
runtime pm before the system suspend, then after resume, the kernel will
still show that it is runtime suspended, even though it is not.  Then
the disk will keep spinning forever.

We need to check the drive on system resume to see if it is in standby
or not, and force the runtime pm state to match.  I couldn't quite work
out how to do that properly before.  I dug up my old patch series and
have been reviewing it.  If you are interested, it can be found here:
