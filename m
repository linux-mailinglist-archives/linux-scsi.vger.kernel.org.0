Followup: judging by this
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive#External_SSD_with_TRIM_support
,
my problem actually goes even deeper. I see that you can override the
wrongly-set LBPME bit by switching provisioning_mode manually. In my
case though, the LBPU bit is also 0. Argh...

My assumption is that the Windows driver is also made by the chip
manufacturer, so it ignores all the bits as long as it knows what the
identified device should be capable of.

I can switch provisioning_mode, but after that, if I issue a blkdiscard
command of any size, I get an error, and provisioning_mode goes to
"disabled".

Maybe it's because the kernel treats this device as JMS561 (as
advertised by the device), which does not support UNMAP? This is what
gives me this idea:

So... anything I can try in this situation?..
