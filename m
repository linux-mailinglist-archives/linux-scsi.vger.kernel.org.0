I wouldn't say it is a step backwards, just a step forwards the driver is not ready for.

For me, the change causes deadlocks so it is a regression.

I have never seen SCSI EH cause a problem, but AFAICT it is not needed because the UFS driver's error handler is always scheduled when needed.

As a temporary workaround until the driver is ready for SCSI EH, interference between SCSI EH and UFS EH could presumably be avoided by setting eh_strategy_handler to an empty function.

It seems to me that removing "if (hba->pm_op_in_progress)" would cause errors for requests that had not in fact even been issued.
