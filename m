I'm not, I'm just saying the proposed fix is no fix at all since it
would just produce undefined behaviour in the driver.  I thought the
issue might have been coming from VMWare, which is why I asked how the
bug was seen.  The proper fix is probably to fail attachment if the phy
number goes over a fixed value (16 sounds reasonable) but if it's never
a problem in the field, I'm happy doing nothing because we have no real
idea what the reasonable value is.
