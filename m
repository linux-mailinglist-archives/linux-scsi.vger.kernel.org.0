I think cheaper SSDs have a write latency problem due to erase block
issues.  I suspect all SSDs have a channel problem in that there's a
certain number of parallel channels and once you go over that number
they can't actually work on any more operations even if they can queue
them.  For cheaper (as in fewer channels, and less spare erased block
capacity) SSDs there will be a benefit to reducing the depth to some
multiplier of the channels (I'd guess 2-4 as the multiplier).  When
SSDs become write throttled, there may be less benefit to us queueing
in the block layer (merging produces bigger packets with lower
overhead, but the erase block consumption will remain the same).

For the record, the internet thinks that cheap SSDs have 2-4 channels,
so that would argue a tag depth somewhere from 4-16

Possibly ... the stats on most manufacturer SSDs don't give you
information about the channels or spare erase blocks.

If it's an SSD it's likely not giving the queue full you'd need to get
the mid-layer to throttle automatically.
