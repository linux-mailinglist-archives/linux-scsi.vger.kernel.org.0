Although... num_possible_cpus() shouldn't change, but I guess a cpu id 
can be greater than the possible cpu count.

But there is this as well - also from include/linux/cpumask.h:
  *  If HOTPLUG is enabled, then cpu_possible_mask is forced to have
  *  all NR_CPUS bits set, otherwise it is just the set of CPUs that
  *  ACPI reports present at boot.
