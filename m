I haven't commented on them so far because I don't understand them.

If you want to send a command to the underlying device, why do you 
resume the underlying device's _parent_?  Why not resume the device 
itself?

Why is bsg sending commands to the underlying device in a way that 
evades checks for whether the device is suspended?  Shouldn't the 
device's driver already be responsible for automatically resuming the 
device when a command is sent?

Why do you need to send a command to the wlun when the host is being 
suspended?  Shouldn't that command already have been sent, at the time 
when the wlun was suspended?
