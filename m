I think we might want to change this.  With the NUMA scheduler you can end up with
using the non-optimized marginal path.  This happens when we test with 4 paths
(2 optimized and 2 non-optimized) and set all 4 paths to marginal.  In this case
the NUMA scheduler should simply choose the optimized marginal path on the closest
numa node.  However, that's not what happens. It consistently chooses the
non-optimized first non-optimized path.

This is a good question for Broadcom.  I think, with all IO schedulers, as long
as there is a non-marginal path available, that path should be used.  So
a non-marginal non-optimized path should take precedence over a marginal optimized path.

In the case were all paths are marginal, I think the scheduler should simply use the firt
optimized path on the closest numa node.

I don't understand this.  The Round-robin scheduler removes marginal paths, why shouldn't the
queue-depth and numa scheduler do the same?

This may be true with FPIN Congestion Signal, but we are testing Link Integrity.  With FPIN LI I think we want to simply stop using the path.
LI has nothing to do with latency.  So unless ALL paths are marginal, the IO scheduler should not be using any marginal path.

Do we need another state here?  There is an ask to support FPIN CS, so maybe using the term "marginal" to describe LI is wrong.

Maybe we need something like "marginal_li" and "marginal_cs" to describe the difference.
