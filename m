Hi Damien,

Thanks for the detailed feedback.

My concerns about the above proposal are as follows:
* The information about whether or not the zone write lock should be used comes
   from the block driver, e.g. a SCSI LLD.
* sdp, the SCSI disk pointer, is owned by the ULD.
* An ULD may be attached and detached multiple times during the lifetime of a
   logical unit without the LLD being informed about this. So how to set
   sdp->use_zone_write_lock without introducing a new callback or member variable
   in a data structure owned by the LLD?

Hence my preference to store use_zone_write_lock in a data structure that has the
same lifetime as the logical unit and not in any data structure controlled by the
ULD.

How about the request-based dm drivers (dm-mpath and dm-target)? Isn't the dm-mpath
driver request based because that allows the I/O scheduler to be configured on top
of the dm-mpath driver? From https://lwn.net/Articles/274292/: "The basic idea to
resolve the issue is to move multipathing layer down below the I/O scheduler, and it
was proposed from Mike Christie as the block layer (request-based) multipath".

Thanks,

Bart.
