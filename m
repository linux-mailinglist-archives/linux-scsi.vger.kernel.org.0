Hi Vinod and Jeffrey,

Let me summary here, now the 1000000us timeout works for both 845 and 
8998.
However, 8150 still fails.

>> The bigger question is why is the reset causing the timeout to be
>> increased for sdm845 and not to work in case of sm8150! (Vinod)

I would not say this patch increases the timeout. With this patch,
the PCS polling timeout, per my profiling, the PCS ready usually needs
less than 5000us, which is the actual time needed for PCS bit to be 
ready.

The reason why 1000us worked for you is because, w/o the patch, UFS PHY
registers are retained from pre-kernel stage (bootloader i.e.), the PCS 
ready
bit was set to 1 in pre-kernel stage, so when kernel driver reads it, it 
returns
1, not even to be polled at all. It may seem "faster", but not the right
thing to do, because kernel stage may need different PHY settings than
pre-kernel stage, keeping the settings configured in pre-kernel stage is 
not
always right, so this patch is needed. And increasing 1000us to 
1000000us
is the right thing to do, but not a hack.

As reg for the phy initialization timeout on 8150, I found there is 
something
wrong with its settings in /drivers/phy/qualcomm/phy-qcom-qmp.c

static const struct qmp_phy_init_tbl sm8150_ufsphy_serdes_tbl[] = {
	QMP_PHY_INIT_CFG(QPHY_POWER_DOWN_CONTROL, 0x01),
	QMP_PHY_INIT_CFG(QSERDES_V4_COM_SYSCLK_EN_SEL, 0xd9),

"QMP_PHY_INIT_CFG(QPHY_POWER_DOWN_CONTROL, 0x01)" should NOT appear in 
the serdes
table! I haven't check who made this change, but please have a try after 
remove
this line from sm8150_ufsphy_serdes_tbl.

Thanks.
Can Guo.
