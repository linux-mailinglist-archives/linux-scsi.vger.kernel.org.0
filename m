Hi Damien,

The call trace mentioned above comes from the kernel log and was
encountered while I was testing this patch series. A reproducer has
already been shared - see also
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/e840b66a-79f0-4169-9ab1-c475d9608e4d@acm.org/. 
The lockup happened after the queue was filled up
with requests and hence sd_zbc_report_zones() failed to allocate an
additional request for the zone report.

I'm wondering whether this lockup can also happen with the current
upstream kernel by submitting multiple unaligned writes simultaneously
where each write affects another zone and where the number of writes
matches the queue depth.

Thanks,

Bart.
