Add more - besides, SSU cmd is not the only PM request sent during 
suspend/resume,
last year (before your changes came in) it also sends request sense cmd 
without
checking the return value of it - so if request sense cmd abort happens, 
suspend/resume
still move forward, which can run concurrently with error handling. So I 
was pursuing
a way to make error handler less dependent on the bahaviours of these 
contexts.
