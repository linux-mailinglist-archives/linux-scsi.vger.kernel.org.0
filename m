No, it wasn't.  Another routine, blk_pm_allow_request(), was removed by 
that commit, but almost no other code was deleted.  Maybe you're thinking 
of a different commit?

In any case, I don't understand the point you're trying to make.

Here's what I _do_ understand: While the queue is in the RPM_SUSPENDED 
state, it can't carry out any requests at all.  If a request is added to 
the queue, the queue must be resumed before the request can be issued to 
the lower-layer drivers -- no matter what flags are set in the request.

Right now there doesn't seem to be any mechanism for resuming the queue 
if an REQ_PREEMPT request is added while the queue is suspended.
