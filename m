LSI SAS HBAs (LSI now owned by Broadcom) implement an internal ** SMP
target. It can be seen here:

# ls /dev/bsg
3:0:0:0  3:0:3:0  8:0:0:0  8:0:0:3	     end_device-3:1    expander-3:0
3:0:1:0  4:0:0:0  8:0:0:1  8:0:0:4	     end_device-3:1:0  expander-3:1
3:0:2:0  7:0:0:0  8:0:0:2  end_device-3:0:1  end_device-3:2    sas_host3

It is the last device node: "sas_host3". How do I know it is a SMP target?
Because this works:

# smp_read_gpio /dev/bsg/sas_host3
Read GPIO register response:
   GPIO_CFG[0]:
     version: 0
     GPIO enable: 1
     cfg register count: 2
     gp register count: 1
     supported drive count: 16

When you work out what LSI are doing with this, perhaps you could write
an article about it and make it publicly available.
It is always a good idea to see how your competitors solve problems :-)

** I call it "internal" because it is not seen when doing a SMP DISCOVER
    on a SAS expander to which that SAS HBA is connected.
