Subject: [PATCH v18 00/45] sg: add v4 interface

This patchset is the first stage of a two stage rewrite of the scsi
generic (sg) driver. The main goal of the first stage is to introduce
the sg v4 interface that uses 'struct sg_io_v4' as well as keeping and
modernizing the sg v3 interface (based on 'struct sg_io_hdr'). The
async interface formerly requiring the use of write() and read()
system calls now have ioctl(SG_IOSUBMIT) and ioctl(SG_IORECEIVE)
replacements.

A recent patch to fio allows its sg engine to issue iopoll requests
by using hipri=1 in the fio script. When testing sg device nodes
with fio this option must be set: direct=0. The sync option may
be set to 0 (use sg's write/read async interface) or 1 (uses
ioctl(SG_IO) interface).

For documentation see:
    https://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg_v40.html which is mirrored at:
    https://doug-gilbert.github.io/sg_v40.html

This patchset is against Martin Petersen's 5.13/scsi-queue branch.

Changes since v17 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210407)
  - make clearer distinction between user pollable (i.e. async)
    requests and (user) non-pollable requests (e.g. those injected
    with ioctl(SG_IO), IOWs sync requests)
  - fix crash in sg_start_req() when blk_get_request() yields an
    error (e.g. -EAGAIN when low on resources)
  - sg_finish_scsi_blk_rq(): remove now_zero variable as suggested
    by Hannes R.
  - change deprecation warning url reference from http to https

Changes since v16 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210208)
  - sg_start_req() fix double free on error path [KASAN]
  - sg_rq_map_kern() fix uninitialized variable [coverity]
  - sg_add_sfp() fix use after free [coverity]
  - sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(): remove pointless NULL check [coverity]
  - fix misuse of WARN_ONCE in sg_rq_end_io_usercontext() [D. Carpenter]
  - remove unused error checks: tracking blk_put_request() calls and
    multiple SG_XA_RQ_FREE calls
  - hipri: as blk_poll() can return > 0 for requests other than the one
    that is being checked for, need to re-check that request is ready
  - rebased on MKP's 5.13/scsi-queue

Changes since v15 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210125)
  - tweak state machine which sets INFLIGHT state _before_
    blk_execute_rq_nowait() is called. Add a bit flag that indicates
    the logic flow has returned from that call. This guards against
    blk_poll() being called before the block layer has really
    launched the request.
  - fix bug clearing SG_FFD_HIPRI_SEEN bit as
    atomic_dec_and_test() returns true when the post-decrement value
    is zero, the opposite of what a C conditional does.

Changes since v14 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210124)
  - two fixes based on report from Dan Carpenter and kernel test
    robot
  - fix Johannes Thumshirn's email address
  - separate patch issued on fio to add 'hipri' option to its sg
    engine. Enables fio to test new sg driver blk_poll() support

Changes since v13 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20210113)
  - fix obscure compile error reported by "kernel test robot
    <lkp@intel.com>"
  - harden code around blk_poll() invocation; needed based on
    fio testing
  - remove SG_FFD_MMAP_CALLED bit code after Hannes Reinecke pointed
    out it was redundant

Changes since v12 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20201115)
  - add blk_poll() support, prefix that patch's subject with 'RFC'

Changes since v11 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20201014)
  - no author originated changes since v11
  - port from lk 5.9.0-rc1 to lk 5.10.0-rc1 picks up a change to
    the import_iovec() which requires a change to patch 25/44
  - only publish this cover letter and v12 of patch 25/44 to
    the linux-scsi list. The other 43 patches remain as published
    on 20201014.

Changes since v10 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20200823)
  - unchanged: 0001 to 0009, 0010 to 0017
  - rename sg_add_req() to sg_setup_req() [0010]
  - patches 40,41,42 and 43 are new, see their commit messages
  - remove SG_RS_RCV_DONE request state leaving 3.5 states
    [the 0.5 state is SG_RS_BUSY]
  - rework sg_rq_chg_state() code that enforces request
    state changes and associated xarray marks
  - track lowest used and unused indexes in the request arrays so
    iterations over the request xarray are efficient. This is a
    significant saving when the iodepth queue length is large

Changes since v9 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20200421)
  - rebase on MKP's 5.10/scsi-queue branch
  - remove some master/slave terminology that had bled in from
    the part 2 patchset
  - change sg_request::start_ns type from ktime_t to u64
  - pick up several error path correction fixes applied to the
    sg driver by other authors

Changes since v8 to v1 in earlier patchsets
  - see: the v10 patchset sent to linux-scsi on 20200823
