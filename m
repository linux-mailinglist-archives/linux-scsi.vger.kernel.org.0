Hi Bart,

IMO that means the field is undocumented rather than RESERVED on 2500
series chips.

Firmware can do implicit login, and this is how it worked for a while.

Then explicit login was introduced in the commit you referenced by
setting bit 8 in IFCB fimwrare options 3 for 2600/2700 series and
issuing ELS IOCB. However, for 2500 series, bit 7 should be set to
disable implicit logins.

The latest commits that touches the bit is 8777e4314d397 ("scsi: qla2xxx:
Migrate NVME N2N handling into state machine"). It sets the bit in
qla24xx_nvram_config regadless of chip.

Does it help to set bit 7 in IFCB, firmware options 3 for 2500 series
and leave the RESERVED S_ID field untouched?

Thanks,
Roman
