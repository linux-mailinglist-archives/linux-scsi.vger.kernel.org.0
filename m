The block layer does this in block/blk-core.c:blk_queue_enter(), as part 
of the condition check in the call to wait_event() near the end of the 
function.  The blk_pm_request_resume() inline routine calls 
pm_request_resume().

At least, that's what is _supposed_ to happen.  See commit 0d25bd072b49 
("block: Schedule runtime resume earlier").

I don't remember the reason.  It may be that the code in sr.c isn't 
needed.

I don't know what's going wrong.  Bart, can you look into it?  As far as I 
can tell, you're the last person to touch the block-layer's runtime PM 
code.
