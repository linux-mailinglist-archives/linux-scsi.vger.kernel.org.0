If the system is shut down before the sync or drive unmounting and the
write cache is enabled, there might be the loss of data in the cache,
but this is because of the way the drive is designed.

I believe the kernel should support the drive as it is - plug and play
- without requiring cumbersome configurations.

Disabling the write cache for increased data security is up to the user
eventually requiring an increased level of safety against data loss.

In those earlier days, most operating systems were giving the user very
specific warning about the risks of write caching. Such warnings have
now been removed because of the advent of more recent hard-drive
specifications supporting new features such as the Synchronize Cache
command, but in my opinion this has nothing to do with the fact that
earlier drives should be supported in a plug and play fashion as they
were in earlier days.
