In your scheme, yes.  Do you ever need to look up scsi_device from
a scsi_host with only the C:T:L as a key (and it's a situation where
speed matters)?  Everything I've seen so far is about iterating every
sdev in an shost, but maybe this is a "when you have a hammer" situation.

But using the allocating XArray will outperform both the linked list and
the direct-store XArray that you're proposing.

The rbtree is even worse than the linked list if your primary API is
"iterate all objects".
