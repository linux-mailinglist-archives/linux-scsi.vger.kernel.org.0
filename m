I still did not get why you wrapping core_tmr_drain_*_list by mutex.
general_tmr_list have only aborts now and they do not wait for other aborts.

OMG, yes, of course, you a right. I messed up something.

But I have concerns still:
transport_lookup_tmr_lun (where LUN_RESET is added to the list) and
transport_generic_handle_tmr(where LUN_RESET is scheduled to handle)
are not serialized. And below you can start the second LUN_RESET while
transport_generic_handle_tmr is not yet called for it. The _handle_tmr
could be delayed for a such time that is enough to handle that second
LUN_RESET and to clear the flag. _handle_tmr will then start the work
again.

Is it worth doing that list management? Is it not enough just wrap
calling core_tmr_lun_reset() in target_tmr_work by a mutex?

Yes, in general, bit setting is not atomic, write of some bit can
clear other bit being write in parallel.
Better to have a separarte variable used only under lock.
