Doing a git grep -iw lba in block will refute this.  I think the
partition code still uses it because it's what most standards still
say.

To be clear, I think that using _pos everywhere is at least consistent,
even if I think it's not very logical, so I'm happy on that basis.  I'm
just not happy with the attempt to characterise LBA as confusing since
it's been the terminology forever and still permeates at least the
partition code in block and predates the logical/physical addition to
the SCSI standards.  Just say that for consistency we'd like to use
_pos everywhere ... or if you want to use _sector, that's OK, but then
update block as well.

Historically, logical meant our internal sector size, i.e. 512 and
physical meant whatever the device returned until the SCSI committee
suddenly wanted their own versions of logical and physical to cover for
the 4k block size fiasco.
