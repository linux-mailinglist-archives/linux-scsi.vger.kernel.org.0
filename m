yes, which is annoying. Back to the days where ATA max qd was 31...

Well, it is not really free. It is unused as far as the device is
concerned since the command that needs to be checked completed. But not
free yet since we need to do the read log first before being able to
scsi-complete the command (which will free the tag). So if we use the
regular submission path to issue the read log, we must be guaranteed that
we can get a tag, otherwise we will deadlock. Hence the need to reserve
one tag.

I tried that. It is very ugly... Problem is that integration with EH in
case a real NCQ error happens when all that read-log-complete dance is
happening is hard. And don't get me started with the need to save/restore
the scsi command context of the command we are reusing the tag from.

And given that the code is changing to use regular submission path for
internal commands, right now, we need a reserved tag. Or a way to "borrow"
the tag from a request that we need to check. Which means we need some
additional api to not always try to allocate a tag.

Hmmm.... that would be no better than using EH which does stop processing
until the internal house keeping is done.

> Hmm?

See above. Not free, but usable as far as the device is concerned since we
have at least on command we need to check completed at the device level
(but not yet completed from scsi/block layer point of view).
