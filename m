Yes, no, and possibly :-)

The gdth hardware is based on the i960 chip, and has borrowed quite some 
concepts for the now-defunct I2O design.
Plus it's PCI and SCSI parallel only, so it took me quite some time to 
find a machine where I could fit both in.

So I do agree that this could be classified as obsolete, much like we 
did with the I2O subsystem some years back.
Would actually save me quite some time, as the driver itself is really 
just too ugly to behold in its current state.
And bringing it into this century would amount to basically a rewrite.

Cheers,

Hannes
