I think it depends on the scenario in which commands are aborted.
For "regular" aborts, you're certainly right. But in certain scenarios,
e.g. controller removal or module unloading, the current driver shuts
down the firmware early in the shutdown process, and once the firmware
is stopped, I suppose it will not report completions any more.

Whether it was a good idea in the first place to shut down the FW so
early is a different issue, which I tried to adress with the 2 patches
I submitted on Nov. 29th.

Regards,
Martin
