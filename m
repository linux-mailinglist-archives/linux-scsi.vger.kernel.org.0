How common do you think this state would be? On the one hand, having a 
generic
state that the transport is kept a live but simply refuses to accept I/O 
sounds like
a generic state, but I can't think of an equivalent in the other transports.

If this is something that is private to FC, perhaps the right way is to 
add a flag
for it that only fc sets, and when a second usage of it appears, we 
promote it
to a proper controller state. Thoughts?
