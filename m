It's not any form of secret: some ideas are just easier to implement
and lead to useful features and others don't.  It's exactly why we
insist on code based discussions.  It's also why standards that aren't
driven by implementations can be problematic: what sounds good on paper
doesn't necessarily work out well in practice.

I don't think anyone can give you this.  If it could be achieved then
all the standards bodies that are currently forced to deal with
implementations could happily go back to abstract proposals.
