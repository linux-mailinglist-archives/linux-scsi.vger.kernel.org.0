This is the same issue I have had since day #1.

Generally mount/unmount or even fdisk -l fails after booting into 
miniramfs. I wouldn't ever try to boot a distro.

I'm just trying SAS disks to start with - so it's an SCSI READ command. 
SATA/STP support is generally never as robust for SAS HBAs (HW and LLD 
bugs are common - as this series is evidence) so I start on something 
more basic - however SATA/STP also has this issue.

The command is sent successfully but just never completes. Then 
sometimes the TMFs for error handling timeout and sometimes succeed. I 
don't have much to do on....

Yes, and it is commonly the first SCSI read command which times out. It 
reliably breaks quite early. So I can think we can rule out issues like 
memory barriers/timing.

Not sure on that. I guess it isn't.

Thanks,
