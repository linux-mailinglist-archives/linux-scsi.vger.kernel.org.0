I have never seen this happen (i mean UNIT ATTENTION being returned) in
practice with SAS HDDs. Not sure how zoned UFS devices behave though.

But it seems that all we need to do is a better request handling in the
requeue+dispatch queue to handle requeued writes. I am not yet convinced that
zone write plugging needs a lot of changes beside allowing more than one write
per zone and some form of throttling based on feedback from the requeue path.
I.e. the current code throttles write command issuing every time one command is
submitted: the submission "plugs" the write plug. In your case, it seems that
the plugging should be driven by the requeue path, or the driver. Unplugging of
a plug happens currently when a BIO completes, but in your case, it would need
to be also driven by the requeue path or driver.

I am thinking that things could be cleaner/easier to maintain with a zoned
write requeue special path. May be... I am thinking aloud here as I have not
tried to code anything.
