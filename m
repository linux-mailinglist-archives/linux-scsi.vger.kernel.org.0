You just see large IO size from driver side or device side, and do you
know why the big size IO is submitted to driver? Block layer's IO merge
contributes a lot for that, and IO merge usually starts to work
after queue becomes busy which can be signaled from !blk_mq_get_dispatch_bu=
dget().

That is why we implements .get_budget and .put_budget on SCSI for fixing
sequential IO performance regression.

0df21c86bdbf scsi: implement .get_budget and .put_budget for blk-mq
aeec77629a4a scsi: allow passing in null rq to scsi_prep_state_check()
b347689ffbca blk-mq-sched: improve dispatching from sw queue
de1482974080 blk-mq: introduce .get_budget and .put_budget in blk_mq_ops

Also HDD may be connected to high end HBA too.

Yeah, that is why my patches just bypass sdev->device_busy for SSD, and
looks you misunderstood the idea behind the patches, right?
