I was using mkp 5.18 staging tree from yesterday as baseline:
https://github.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/commits/private-topic-sas-5.17-damien-pm8001-v3

If I start using rc4 then I would get conflicts (which obviously would 
be resolvable easily enough), but I doubt it is an issue (in using rc1).

That would be brilliant if you could. This problem could even be down to 
defconfig differences (between arm64 and x86_64).

Thanks,
