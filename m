It's complicated.  A request with bd->last == false _will_ always be
followed by a request with bd->last == true in the same batch.  However,
due to e.g. errors it may be possible that the last request is not sent.
 In that case, the block layer sends commit_rqs, as documented in the
comment above, to flush the requests that have been sent already.

So, a driver that obeys bd->last (or SCMD_LAST) but does not implement
commit_rqs is bound to have bugs, which is why this patch was not split
further.

Makes sense?
