Hi all-

We already anticipated the need for the "spinning rust" bit, so it is
already in place (on paper, at least).

SAS currently supports QD256, but the general consensus is that most
customers don't run anywhere near that deep. Does it help the system
for the HD to report a limited (256) max queue depth, or is it really
up to the system to decide many commands to queue?

Regarding number of SQ pairs, I think HDD would function well with
only one. Some thoughts on why we would want >1:
-A priority-based SQ servicing algorithm that would permit
low-priority commands to be queued in a dedicated SQ.
-The host may want an SQ per actuator for multi-actuator devices.
There may be others that I haven't thought of, but you get the idea.
At any rate, the drive can support as many queue-pairs as it wants to
- we can use as few as makes sense.

Since NVMe doesn't guarantee command execution order, it seems the
zoned block version of an NVME HDD would need to support zone append.
Do you agree?
