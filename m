host-tag patchset is only for several particular drivers which use
private reply queue as completion queue.

This patchset is for handling generic blk-mq CPU hotplug issue, and
the several particular scsi drivers(hisi_sas_v3, hpsa, megaraid_sas and
mp3sas) won't be covered so far.

I'd suggest to move on for generic blk-mq devices first given now blk-mq
is the only request IO path now.

There are at least two choices for us to handle drivers/devices with
private completion queue:

1) host-tags
- performance issue shouldn't be hard to solve, given it is same with
with single tags in theory, and just corner cases is there.

What I am not glad with this approach is that blk-mq-tag code becomes mess.

2) private callback
- we could define private callback to drain each completion queue in
  driver simply.
- problem is that the four drivers have to duplicate the same job


Thanks,
