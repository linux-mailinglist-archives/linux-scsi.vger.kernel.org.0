Hi Bart, just an update for you. I noticed this had been removed from the
6.0-rc1 for freezing after suspend.

I've been compiling my kernel with this fix on various 5.18 kernels (with
opensuse tumbleweed), it has worked fine, no freezing on resume as others h=
ave
mentioned.

Yesterday, I updated to 5.19.2 kernel, applied the fix, recompiled, and it
froze after the first suspend. Rebooted and the same thing happened again. I
recompiled the kernel with the fix, just to make sure i didn't mess it up, =
and
the same happened again.

When you originally did this fix, you based it on 5.18, and indeed, it works
fine on 5.18 for me. There were a lot of changes to the drivers/scsi/sd.c f=
ile
for 5.19, presumably it was those changes that made this fix start freezing
after suspend.

Perhaps you could check if the other people that experienced freezing were
using either 5.19 or 6.0-rc1.

Hopefully, this information might help in finding the cause and re-fixing t=
his
issue.

Thanks for all you help
