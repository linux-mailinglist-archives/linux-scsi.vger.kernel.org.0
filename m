blk-mq has already puts a limit on each LUN, the number is
host_queue_depth / nr_active_LUNs, see hctx_may_queue().

Looks this way works for NVMe, that is why I try to bypass
.device_busy for SSD which is too expensive on fast storage. Even
Hannes wants to kill it completely.

I understand SATA's host queue depth is set as 32.

But SAS HBA's queue depth is often big, so do we reply on .device_busy for
throttling requests to SAS?

For SSD, I guess it might be fine, given NVMe sets per-hw-queue depth
as 1023 usually. That means the concurrent requests can be as many as=20
1023 * nr_hw_queues in case of single namespace.

OK, one conservative approach may be just to just bypass .device_busy=20
in case of SSD only for some high end HBA.

Or maybe we can wire up sdev->queue_depth with block layer's scheduler
queue depth? One issue is that sdev->queue_depth may be updated some
times.

Thanks,
Ming
