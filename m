Hi Christoph,

Here is some additional background information:
* UFS vendors prefer the SCSI command set because they combine it with the
   M-PHY transport layer. This combination is more power efficient than NVMe
   over PCIe. According to the information I have available power consumption
   in the M-PHY hibernation state is lower than in the PCIe L2 state. I have
   not yet heard about any attempts to combine the NVMe command set with the
   M-PHY transport layer. Even if this would be possible, it would fragment
   the mobile storage market. This would increase the price of mobile storage
   devices which is undesirable.
* I think that the "established NVMe model" in your email refers to the NVMe
   zone append command. As you know there is no zone append in the SCSI ZBC
   standard.
* Using the software implementation of REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND in drivers/scsi/sd_zbc.c
   is not an option. REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND commands are serialized by that
   implementation. This serialization is unavoidable because a SCSI device
   may respond with a unit attention condition to any SCSI command. Hence,
   even if REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND commands are submitted in order, these may be
   executed out-of-order. We do not want any serialization of SCSI commands
   because this has a significant negative performance impact on IOPS for UFS
   devices. The latest UFS devices support more than 300 K IOPS.
* Serialization in the I/O scheduler of zoned writes also reduces IOPS more
   than what is acceptable.

Hence the approach of this patch series to support pipelining of zoned writes
even if no I/O scheduler has been configured.

I think the amount of complexity introduced by this patch series in the SCSI
core is reasonable. No new states are introduced in the SCSI core. A single
call to a function that reorders pending SCSI commands is introduced in the
SCSI error handler (scsi_call_prepare_resubmit()).

Thanks,

Bart.
