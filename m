Yes, I know. But that's the user-space API; there is nothing forcing us 
to continue using it internally as long as we keep the userspace API intact.

No, not really. I've got a patch for that; we should have separated the 
CAM values from the SAM status values a long time ago.

Indeed, the _drivers_ do.
But the SCSI midlayer does not; is just checks for a non-zero value here.
So we can easily map a non-zero message byte to DID_ERROR before calling 
->scsi_done(), allowing us to keep the message byte handling within the 
SCSI parallel drivers.

I got patches for that ...

... true, but then your patchset suffers from the same issue, no?

I'm currently porting the patchset to 5.13/scsi-queue, and hope to have 
it published soon.

Don't get me wrong; I like your idea with introducing enums for stricter 
type-checking in the SCSI stack.
My point is simply that if we were converting the SCSI result (for 
whatever reason) we should drop those bits which are pointless (like 
DRIVER_SENSE), or never have been used at all (like DRIVER_HARD).

Cheers,

Hannes
