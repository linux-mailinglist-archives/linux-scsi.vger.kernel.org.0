Hi Hector,

thanks for the long and detailed answer! I learn new things
all the time. (Maybe one day I add something too, who knows.)

I hope I'm not taking too much of your time, we're having fun :)

Actually what we did (I was there, kind of) was to go to the flash vendors
(IIRC first Intel) and require what is today called "fuses" in the flash
memory.

Originally this was for things like unique serial numbers set in
production. But they could easily add some more of it for other
use cases.

This became what is known as OTP (one time programmable flash).
The OTP was all set to 1:s when the flash was new, then what we
did for anti-rollback was to designate some bits for software versions.

To make sure the OTP readout wasn't tampered with, some additional
hashes of the OTP was stored in the flash and MAC signed. This was
recalculated when we changed a bit from 1->0 in the OTP to indicate
a new firmware version.

Clever, isn't it? :)

I think the scheme in RPMB was based in part on the needs
solved by that crude mechanism.

(Linux MTD did actually even gain some support for OTP recently,
it is used only from userspace AFIAK.)

Yeah. Hm, actually if they had flash memory they should have
used the OTP... But I suppose they were all on eMMC.

Yep you're right.

OK I understand. So what you're saying is we can't develop
anything without also developing a full policy system.

This example of using the RPMB to protect rollback of a git
was really nice! I think I understood as much before but
maybe I don't explain that well enough :/

I agree.

It's an example all kernel developers can relate to, so the
educational value is high!

As of now there are no other real world examples than TEE
for this user policy. TPM and secure enclave exist, but they both
have their own counters and does not need this.

Can one realistically imagine another secure environment
needing a RPMB counter? If not, then TEE (tee-supplicant is
the name of the software daemon in userspace for OP-TEE,
then some vendors have their own version of TEE)
will ever be the only user, and then we only need to design
for that.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
