No.

Not like device object refcnt, module refcnt is special, it is grabbed when
someone is using the device, then module won't be unloaded when there is
active user. When no one uses the device, we should allow rmmod to
unload the module.

SCSI stack models the device uses via scsi_device_get() and scsi_device_put(),
such as, when one disk is opened, scsi_device_get() is called, and
scsi_device_put() is called when the disk is closed.

Wrt. this issue, we can think that the LLD module holds one device refcnt of
the scsi_host, and the refcnt is dropped when running module_exit(). But
one disk attached to the host may still be opened by userspace, so
the scsi_host won't be released until the disk is closed, and the LLD
module won't be unloaded until the disk is closed too. When the disk
is closed, scsi_device_put() is called and module_put() can unload the
LLD module immediately if rmmod is started.

So what the patch is doing is that we need to make sure that module
refcnt is put after the device is released since the host is released
from its release handler directly if rmmod has been started.


Thanks,
Ming
