It might even get worse, as during device setup things like 
'slave_alloc' etc is getting called, which has a fair chance of getting 
confused for non-existing devices.
Cf qla2xxx:qla2xx_slave_alloc() is calling starget_to_rport(), which 
will get us a nice oops when accessing a target which is _not_ the child 
of a fc remote port.
And this is why I'm not utterly keen on this approach; auditing all 
these callbacks is _not_ fun.

Hannes
