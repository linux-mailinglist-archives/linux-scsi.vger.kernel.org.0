The same thing happens in suspend / S3.

You are saying that right now, the sd driver issues a START UNIT command
on system resume ( it looks like there's a flag you can set now to prevent
that ), then leaves the runtime pm state looking like the drive is still
suspended?  I thought it handled that correctly but I don't see any code
doing so right now.

If that's the case, then I suppose this series at least does not make
things worse...
