Clearly that patch did not disable interrupts. It removed a statement that 
enabled them.

It's hard to see any benefit. But it's easy to see risk, when there's no 
indication that you've confirmed that the affected drivers do not rely on 
the irq lock, nor tested them for regressions, nor checked whether the 
affected platforms meet your assumuptions.

A "cleanup" does not change program behaviour. Can you demonstrate that 
program behaviour is unchanged?
