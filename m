(replying to my own email)

Hi Hannes,

Allocating a struct scsi_device for internal requests seems tricky to me. The
most straightforward approach would be to call scsi_alloc_sdev(). However, that
function accepts a scsi_target pointer and calls .slave_alloc(). So a
scsi_target structure would have to be set up before that function is called and
SCSI LLDs would have to be audited to verify that .slave_alloc() works fine for
the H:C:I:L tuple assigned to the fake SCSI device. Additionally, how should the
inquiry data be initialized that is filled in by scsi_add_lun()?

Since I do not use SCSI hardware that needs a scsi_device to be associated with
internal requests, I prefer that this functionality is implemented in a future
patch series. Changing the hba->host->internal_queue occurrences in the UFS
driver into something like hba->host->internal_sdev->request_queue once this
functionality is implemented should be easy.

Thanks,

Bart.
