From: Martin Wilck <mwilck@suse.com>

Most modern SCSI devices provide VPD page 83 with at least one highly
reliable device identifier, like NAA Registered Extended or EUI-64, or
the ata-id identifier. Other device identifier types have shown to be less
reliable and possibly ambiguous. Ambiguity in particular is a problem with
multipath-tools, which may group unrelated devices together in a multipath
map, causing possible data corruption.

The device identifiers are used in two independent ways by the udev rules:
a) to set ID_SERIAL for subsystems like multipath, and b) to create
/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-... symlinks. Our udev rules have traditionally created
symlinks for every device identifier obtained from either VPD 83 or 80. This
may cause issues, especially on large installments with storage devices that
exhibit the same identifier for many logical units. At the same time, these
symlinks are rarely used.

Avoid using unreliable identifiers for setting ID_SERIAL, and don't create
symlinks for these identifiers. Add a configuration method that allows
users to easily re-enable these methods and symlinks if they need to
(this might be the case on systems with legacy devices that are referenced
in /etc/crypttab, lvm.conf, or the like). This is done by introducing
environment variables .SCSI_ID_SERIAL_SRC and .SCSI_ID_SYMLINK_SRC, to
control use of device identifiers for determining ID_SERIAL and for creating
symlinks, respectively. Both variables can contain the letters "T", "L", "V",
and "S" to enable T10-vendor ID, NAA local ID, vendor-specific ID, and VPD 80
based ID, respectively.

Distributions can change the defaults for these environment variables
to provide backward compatibility for their users, while offering users
an easy way to change the settings.

I'm sending this as RFC, because I expect that not everyone will agree
which identifiers should be enabled by default.

  55-scsi-sg3_id.rules: don't set unreliable device ID by default
  58-scsi-sg3_symlink.rules: don't create extra by-id symlinks by
    default
  udev: add 00-scsi-sg3_config.rules for user configuration
