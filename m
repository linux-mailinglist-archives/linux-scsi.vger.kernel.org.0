From my perspective, the ALUA transitioning state is a temporary state
where the target is saying that it does not have a permanent state
yet. Having the initiator try another pg to me doesn't seem like the
right thing for it to do. If the target wanted the initiator to use a
different pg, it should use an ALUA state which would make that clear,
standby, unavailable, etc. The target would only return an error state
if it was aware that some other path is in an active state.When
transitioning is returned, I don't think the initiator should assume
that any other pg would be a better choice. I think it should assume
that the target will make its intention clear for that path with a
permanent state within a transition timeout.

From my perspective the right thing to do is to let the ALUA handler
do what it is trying to do. If the pg state is transitioning and
within the transition timeout it should continue to retry that request
checking each time the transition timeout. In most cases the target
will easily change its state within the transition timeout and the
subsequent requests for that pg will either fail if the state has
transitioned to an error state, standby, etc., or the request will be
served as it has transitioned to an active state. If the target
misbehaves for the pg and stays in transition too long then the
handler will change the state from transition to standby and
subsequent I/O will fail on that path.
