Hello

I apologize for using this medium to contact you. My name is Barrister
Tchao Ago Bazaa and I am a lawyer by profession. I am contacting you
in respect of my late client who bears the same surname as you and a
citizen of your country, my late client died in a car accident along
with his family some years back, leaving no next of kin. My late
client  was a business man who was into the oil and gold business here
in my country.

He left behind a fund deposit value of  ( Five Million Nine Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars only ) the bank where this money was
deposited is trying to confiscate it, since i cannot locate any member
of the family a long time after his demise, I therefore seek your
since partnership since you share the same family names with my late
client and probably from the same country, do not hesitate to send me
the following information below for easy  communication and endeavor
to reply through my private email address for more details:

Your full names
Your private Telephone Number

Thanks

Tchao Ago Bazaa
