Hi Maciej,

Do you mean use OpCode 01 (INITIALIZE MAILBOX) to set a 24-bit address
for mailbox in place of OpCode 81? Verifying the change would be a
challenge. Do you have an old adapter to test it with? If you do, go
ahead and make the changes. I will be happy to review. I have only a
BT-757 adapter.

Thanks,
Khalid
