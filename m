FS IO, and passthrough IO from userspace at least, since
that is what user cares.

Also the bdev/disk is guaranteed to be live when this userspace
passthrough IO is inflight.

The special flag is just for recognizing userspace passthrough IO.

That is basically to make bio->bi_bdev points to part0, and the
problem is that you have to make sure that part0 won't be released
when this request is inflight.

No, I meant that bio->bi_bdev isn't setup yet for passthrough request,
and not sure that can be done easily.
