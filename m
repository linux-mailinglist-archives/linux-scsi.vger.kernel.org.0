If you don't mind breaking existing, user space facing APIs, then
yes, they can be dropped ...

Banishing them to the sg header is correct IMO. Which is exactly
what this patch does.

One thought, they could be wrapped with:

#ifndef __KERNEL__
...
#endif

and repeated in a new header: scsi/sg_priv.h
Then the sg driver and any other files that need those old defines
could include sg_priv.h . The result would be parts of the kernel
not being polluted with commonly use names like GOOD and BUSY.


Anyway:
