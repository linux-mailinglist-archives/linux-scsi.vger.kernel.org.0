Different lifetimes between the corresponding struct request and
struct scsi_request objects, on one hand, and a sg_request object on
the other. The former are freed in sg_rq_end_io() (i.e. the callback
from the mid-level) while sg_request object must keep them until the
user space completion (e.g. calls to read() or ioctl(SG_IORECEIVE)).

This comment was left by you (?) or Jens in sg_rq_end_io():
         /*
          * Free the mid-level resources apart from the bio (if any). The bio's
          * blk_rq_unmap_user() can be called later from user context.
          */

I certainly didn't put it there.

Anyway Hannes didn't like a kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) in the callback
and suggested a mempool. Given that the sense buffer is not
required very often, I felt pre-allocating space in a
sg_request object was wasteful.  Got any better ideas?

One idea I floated was making these guys in scsi_lib:
   static struct kmem_cache *scsi_sense_cache;
   static struct kmem_cache *scsi_sense_isadma_cache;

... accessible to ULDs (because the st driver may benefit also) to
transfer ownership and free it when it was no longer needed. This
would allow the sg driver to transfer ownership of the sense
buffer in scsi_request before that scsi_request was "freed". Then
the sg_request could free up that sense_buffer when it was no
longer needed. No-one responded to that idea.
