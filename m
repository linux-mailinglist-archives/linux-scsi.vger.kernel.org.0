May be that "need not be a scsi host" should be expanded to something
that suggests dev_to_shost(first_arg) can resolve to a non-NULL pointer.

Are there restrictions on those intermediate object(s)? Can there be more
than one? If so, can those intermediate objects only form a linear chain
or could it be more complex, an object subtree for example?

Okay, I'll change it and see what breaks.


If you are not familiar with "mark"s in xarrays, they are binary flags
hidden inside the pointers that xarray holds to form a container. With
these flags (two available per xarray) one can make iterations much more
efficient with xa_for_each_marked() { }. The win is that there is no
need to dereference the pointers of collection members that are _not_
marked. After playing with these in my rework of the sg driver, I
concluded that the best thing to mark was object states. Unfortunately
there are only 2 marks *** per xarray but scsi_device, for example, has
9 states in scsi_device_state. Would you like to hazard a guess of
which two (or two groups), if any, are iterated over often enough to
make marking worthwhile?

Those two marks could be stretched to four, sort of, as scsi_device
objects are members of two xarrays in my xarray rework: all sdev objects
in a starget, and all sdev objects in a shost.

*** two flags is only _two_ sub-list possibilities per xarray. So, for
     example, you can't iterate like this (directly):
         xa_for_each_marked(mark1_set && mark2_clear) { }.
