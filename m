Dear Good day,

Please accept my apologies I do not intend to invade your privacy, I
wrote to you earlier, but no answer, in my first post I told you about
my late client's untimely death, I received several letters from his
bank, where he made a deposit of ($7.5 million Dollars) before his
death, the bank asked me to provide his next of kin or any of his
relatives, who will stand for this claim, otherwise it will be
confiscated by the bank due to lack of claims from his relatives hence
I contacted you to present you as his new beneficiary next of kin.
After your reply I shall give you more details and procedures of this
transaction, waiting for your reply

Best Regards,
Mr.Morris Ball.
