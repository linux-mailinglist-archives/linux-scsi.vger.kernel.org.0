Thank you, but that was precisely my question.

Seeing that the driver is using the NVMe mechanism to communicate
commands between the driver and the hardware, doesn't it make it a NVMe
driver?
Especially as you are sending NVMe commands and not SCSI commands, so
you always will have to re-write the incoming SCSI commands into NVMe
commands, and knowing from experience this is not a good fit.

Hence my question: what exactly is SCSI specific on the hardware side?
Wouldn't an implementation as a NVMe driver be a better fit, as then you
could leverage all the existing code like setup prps, completion
handling etc?

Cheers,

Hannes
