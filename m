Thanks Arun,

I think we're all better off if the qla exports the nvme nodes via the 
scsi-side fc_remote_ports.  In the end - we will commonize a fc 
transport that then sits above scsi and nvme and will definitely be 
compatible with what's there. The registration with scsi was rather 
straight-forward for lpfc, so I assume it will be for qla as well and 
the devloss interface, although kludegy to have the driver propagate the 
scsi callback to nvme, also isn't much.

I also don't think we want to keep creating new mgmt points. it's 
already ugly enough.
