Hi Bart,

It looks better, but there is a race condition here. Consider below 
sequence,
thread A takes the clk_scaling_lock and waiting on blk_get_request(), 
while
thread B has frozen the queue and waiting for the lock.

Thread A
     Call ufshcd_exec_dev_cmd() or ufshcd_issue_devman_upiu_cmd()
     [a] down_write(hba->clk_scaling_lock)
     [d] blk_get_request()

Thread B
     Call ufshcd_clock_scaling_prepare()
     [b] blk_freeze_queue_start(hba->cmd_queue)
     [c] blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait_timeout(hba->cmd_queue) returns > 0
     [e] down_write(hba->clk_scaling_lock)

BTW, I see no needs to freeze the hba->cmd_queue in scaling_prepare.
I went through our previous discussions and you mentioned freezing 
hba->cmd_queue
can serialize scaling and err handler.
However, it is not necessary and not 100% true. We've already have 
ufshcd_eh_in_progress()
check in ufshcd_devfreq_target() before call ufshcd_devfreq_scale().
If you think this is not enough(err handler may kick off after this 
check), having
hba->cmd_queue frozen in scaling_prepare() does not mean the err handler 
is finished either,
because device management commands are only used in certain steps during 
err handler.
Actually, with the original design, we don't see any problems caused by
concurrency of scaling and err handler, and if the concurrency really 
happens,
scaling would just fail.

Thanks,

Can Guo.
