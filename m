That is why I asked if NVMe HDD will attempt to sort/merge IO among SQs
from the beginning, but Tim said no, see:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20200212215251.GA25314@ming.t460p/T/#m2d0eff5ef8fcaced0f304180e571bb8fefc72e84

It could be cheap for NVMe HDD to do that, given all queues/requests
just stay in system's RAM.

Also I guess internal IO sort/merge may not be good enough compared with
SW's implementation:

1) device internal queue depth is often low, and the participated requests won't
be enough many, but SW's scheduler queue depth is often 2 times of
device queue depth.

2) HDD drive doesn't have context info, so when concurrent IOs are run from
multiple contexts, HDD internal reorder/merge can't work well enough. blk-mq
doesn't address this case too, however the legacy IO path does consider that
via IOC batch.
