If you would claim that "there are no function changes" in your patches 
(as above) then the onus is on you to support that claim.

I assume that there are some platforms on which your assumptions hold.

With regard to drivers for those platforms, you might want to explain why 
your patches should be applied there, given that the existing code is 
superior for being more portable.

The 'net' subsystem does have some different requirements than the 'scsi' 
subsystem. But I don't see how that's relevant. Perhaps you can explain 
it. Thanks.
