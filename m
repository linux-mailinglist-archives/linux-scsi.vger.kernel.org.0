pm80xx seems the most advanced HBA which uses libsas, so I doubt other 
HBA drivers who use libsas support it. And one of these libsas users, 
hisi_sas, does not even have firmware at all, but would like this kernel 
support at some stage.

And I wouldn't expect expander kernel support, since, as you say, 
expanders can support with firmware. I'm not sure if it's even possible 
for the kernel (host) to support this anyway.

Thanks,
John
