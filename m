OK.

I think only queue re-configuration(blk_revalidate_zone) requires the
queue usage counter. Otherwise, bdev open()/close() should work just
fine.

OK, this reference reuse may be worse, because queue freeze can't prevent new
write zoned bio from being submitted any more given only percpu_ref_get() is
called for all write zoned bios.
