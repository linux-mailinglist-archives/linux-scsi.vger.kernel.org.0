Hi Adrian,

Not for performance reasons. I meant to say that this issue can be fixed 
if we stop the sd devices from suspending until the sd_probe() is completed.

I think the issue is in the sequence of events.
If rpm_put_suppliers() runs after pm_runtime_get_suppliers() this issue 
can occur.

In the good case it'd drop from 3 to 2. But in the bad case, I see that 
it drops to 1. That's when the supplier suspends before the consumer.
That would happen when rpm_put_suppliers() runs after the 
pm_runtime_get_suppliers() is completed and decrements the usage_count 
of supplier until link_active is 1. At that point yes, sd 0:0:0:x has 
really runtime-suspended. sd_probe() would resume it and schedule a 
suspend at the end of probe.

IIUC, below is the sequence of events that can lead to this issue:
1. sd 0:0:0:x schedules an async probe
2. sd 0:0:0:x invokes scsi_autopm_put_device()
3. async probe completes pm_runtime_get_suppliers() increments the 
rpm_active.
4. suspend of sd 0:0:0:x is invoked and rpm_put_suppliers() is invoked 
which decrements the link_active (this was incremented in 3 above)
5. sd_probe() is invoked which resumes it and schedules a suspend
6. pm_runtime_put_suppliers() is invoked which decreases the link_active 
to 1 and supplier suspends before the consumer.

So my solution was to stop sd 0:0:0:x from runtime suspending until the 
sd_probe() is done.

Sure, I've pushed the changes v13 today.
I will test it after the changes are finalized.
