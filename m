What would be not great about it?  libata already takes over the system
suspend/resume from sd.  I'm currently testing having libata do just
this right now.  I just got ahold of some jumpers today to put the
drives back into PuiS and do some further testing tonight.

Last night I again saw the port auto suspend when the scsi disk was
runtime suspended.  Tonight I'll test with PuiS, as well as with system
resume while runtime suspended.  Maybe I'll even try to get the whole
AHCI controller to auto suspend.  It seems like it should once all of
the ports do.

Good point.  I have an eSATA dock with PMP.  I'll check tonight if the
children are counted properly.
