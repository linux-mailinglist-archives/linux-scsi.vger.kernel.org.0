Well, as this patchset nicely demonstrated, no device ever set
DRIVER_BUSY, so that particular code was a bit of optimistic coding.

But you are correct; we should check for negative errors, as those will
be set prior to submission and most likely indicate a temporary error.
(I'd rather _not_ latch on distinct errnos here; there's a deep
call-chain involved and errors along the way might vary.)

Cheers,

Hannes
