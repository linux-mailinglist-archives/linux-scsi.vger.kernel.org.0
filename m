Indeed, if the device is suspending, changing its PM-runtime status to
RPM_SUSPENDED and dropping its power.lock allows a concurrent
rpm_resume() to run and resume the device before the suppliers can be
suspended.

That's incorrect and has been introduced by commit 44cc89f76464 ("PM:
runtime: Update device status before letting suppliers suspend").

It is probably better to revert that commit and address the original
issue in a different way.
