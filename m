I have been looking at elevating hba->clk_scaling_lock to be a general purpose
lock for ufshcd.  That includes allowing down_read if down_write is held already.
The plan being to hold down_write during the error handler instead of releasing it,
which would plug some gaps in synchronization.

So the locking code would look like this:
