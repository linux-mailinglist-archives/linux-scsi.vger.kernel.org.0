Hi Bart,

Agree with all above, and what you ask is right what we are doing in the
3rd change - get rid of host lock on dispatch and completion paths.

I agree with using dedicated spin locks for dedicated purposes in UFS 
driver,
e.g., clk gating has its own gating_lock and clk scaling has its own 
scaling_lock.
But this specific series is only for improving performance. We will take 
your
comments into consideration and address it in future.

Thanks,

Can Guo.
