OK, makes sense.

I amstill looking into this though because I did find a nasty issue: if the HBA
is reset while all the drives connected to it are suspended (spun down), the
drives are never woken up and the drive re-scan trigerred by the PCI reset fails
with command timeouts. And even worse, I hit a deadlock when unloading the
driver after that happens.

All of that should not be happening: the HBA reset should simply result in
either all drives coming back or the drives (scsi devices) being dropped and
re-scan creating new ones. But that I think is not a PCI issue but rather a HBA
driver issue, or a problem with libsas/scsi/libata power management.

Thanks for the comments.
