I tried to reproduce a use-after-free in the device-mapper case, and it doesn't
seem to be possible.  What actually happens is that before freeing the crypto
profile, cleanup_mapped_device() calls del_gendisk(), which deletes the disk
kobject and everything underneath it.  That not only deletes the corresponding
sysfs hierarchy, but also "deactivates" it such that even if a file descriptor
is open to one of the files, attempts to read from it fail with ENODEV.   (It
also waits for any ongoing reads to complete.)

The reference to the disk kobject is indeed released after the crypto profile is
freed, but that doesn't matter as far as sysfs is concerned.

It doesn't appear that concurrent I/O can be a problem either, as the
device-mapper subsystem doesn't allow devices to be deleted while they are open.

It's probably still worth flipping the order of
dm_queue_destroy_crypto_profile() and blk_cleanup_disk() anyway so that it's
less fragile and more similar to the real device drivers, though.

Based on how sysfs works above, with the entire hierarchy being deactivated by
del_gendisk(), I'm not sure this is really a problem either.

The directories would be in different places for different kind of devices (dm,
ufs, mmc, etc.).  I think we really do need the crypto properties in the queue
directory, otherwise it would be a pain for userspace to actually use them.  (It
could also be the disk directory, but the queue directory is what I chose since
that's where most of the other generic block properties related to I/O are.)

If we did add the properties to the device directories (dm, ufs, mmc, etc.) too,
we'd also have to support them there forever in case someone started using them
(which would be uncommon since they would be a pain to use, but someone will do
it anyway), so we should be careful about that.  I think generic block layer
attributes are really the right way to go here.
