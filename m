Reserving a tag is not enough. As explained, even if I can get a tag for a
qc, I need a proper req to safely issue an ncq command (because of the
potential need to delay and requeue even if we have a free tag !).

So reserving a tag/req to be able to do NCQ at the cost of max qd being 31
works for that. We could keep max qd at 32 by creating one more "fake" tag
and having a request for it, that is, having the fake tag visible to the
block layer as a reserved tag, as John's series is doing, but for the
reserved tags, we actually need to use an effective tag (qc->hw_tag) when
issuing the commands. And for that, we can reuse the tag of one of the
failed commands.
