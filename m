These patches were made over mst's vhost branch.

The following patches, made over mst's vhost branch, allow userspace
to set each vq's cpu affinity. Currently, with cgroups the worker thread
inherits the affinity settings, but we are at the mercy of the CPU
scheduler for where the vq's IO will be executed on. This can result in
the scheduler sometimes hammering a couple queues on the host instead of
spreading it out like how the guest's app might have intended if it was
mq aware.

This version of the patches is not what you guys were talking about
initially like with the interface that was similar to nbd's old
(3.x kernel days) NBD_DO_IT ioctl where userspace calls down to the
kernel and we run from that context. These patches instead just
allow userspace to tell the kernel which CPU a vq should run on.
We then use the kernel's workqueue code to handle the thread
management.

I wanted to post this version first, because it is flexible
in that userspace can set things up so devs/vqs share threads/CPUs
and we don't have to worry about replicating a bunch of features
that the workqueue code already has like dynamic thread creation,
blocked work detection, idle thread detection and thread reaping,
and it also has an interface to control how many threads can be
created and which CPUs work can run on if we want to further restrict
that from userspace.

Note that these patches have been lightly tested. I more wanted
to get comments on the overall approach, because I know it's
not really what you were thinking about. But while I worked
on being able to share threads with multiple devices, I kept
coming back to the existing workqueue code and thinking I'll
just copy and paste that.
