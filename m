Which is precisely my concern.
Simple copy might be efficient for one particular implementation, but it 
might be completely off the board for others.
But both will be claiming to support it, and us having no idea whether 
choosing simple copy will speed up matters or not.
Without having a programmatic way to figure out the speed of the 
implementation we have to detect the performance ourselves, like the 
benchmarking loop RAID5 does.
I was hoping to avoid that, and just ask the device/controller; but that 
turned out to be in vain.

Cheers,

Hannes
