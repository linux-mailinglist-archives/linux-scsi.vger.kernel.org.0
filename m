ok, we can take that as a nacked-by for now.

So when you deleted the gdth driver, the request there was to delete 
this API. And in the v8 series, again, the request was not to use it, 
and use the dedicated request queue instead - I do know that this 
conflicts with the much earlier suggestion not to do that, but that was 
when gdth existed.

As for reuse of existing infrastructure, using this API seems to add 
more code than it reuses.

So don't we just need to add a dedicated request_queue for host? I don't 
know the use in having the scsi_device. Having said all that, we don't 
seem to have a host request_queue sysfs entry with either solution, 
which would be good.
