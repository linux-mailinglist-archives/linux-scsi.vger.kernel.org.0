On second thought, I might have been wrong.

The argument I used with the old commit was that we must not unblock the rport 
too early with regards to zfcp-internal recovery. This is fixed within zfcp 
recovery (erp) code. So after zfcp_erp_wait() in host_reset, this is still 
ensured; and eventually the rport unblock will occur.

I guess I was rather worried about returning from the host_reset callback with 
the async rport(s) unblock still pending. After all, (some) other reset_handler 
sync with rport unblock. However I cannot remember all details right now.

Before you invest more time into this, maybe just drop this patch from the 
series for now and we solve it later on? I mean it's not necessary for the 
reset_handler function signature change.
