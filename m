Hi,
I don't understand how this patchset works. My testing shows
scsi_debug is broken and I will be sending a correcting patch
shortly (similar to the one I sent you on 20210108).

The scsi_debug driver is a simplified LLD that needs to know in
advance whether a request/command issued to it will be using the
.mq_poll callback. Perhaps you have found another way but one
simple way to find that out is this test:
    if (request->cmd_flags & REQ_HIPRI)

In the case of scsi_debug (after my patch) the delay associated with
the command is not wired up to generate an event which leads to
completion. Instead, callbacks through .mq_poll are expected and
they will check if that delay has expired, if not the callback returns
0. When the delay has expired and a .mq_poll is received then completion
occurs.
