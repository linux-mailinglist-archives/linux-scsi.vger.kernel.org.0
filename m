Hmmm.  I'm wondering about something you wrote back in June 
(https://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=159345778431615&w=2):

	blk_queue_enter() always - especially when sd is runtime 
	suspended and I try to mount as above - sets success to be true 
	for me, so never continues down to bkl_pm_request_resume(). All 
	I see is "PM: Removing info for No Bus:sda1".

blk_queue_enter() would always set success to be true because pm 
(derived from the BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT flag) is true.  But why was the 
BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT flag set?  In other words, where was 
blk_queue_enter() called from?

Can you get a stack trace (i.e., call dump_stack()) at exactly this 
point, that is, when pm is true and q->rpm_status is RPM_SUSPENDED?  Or 
do you already know the answer?
