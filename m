To me it looks like xen uses nearly the same code like tcm_loop did before my patch.
There is nothing wrong with that code regarding the cmd lifetime.
The problem instead is, that the thread which started a TMR (ABORT_TASK) will sleep forever if that TMR itself is aborted by a further TMR (LUN_RESET).
This is because tcm_loop_aborted_task() misses the complete() call.
 
But if we just add the complete() call to XXXX_aborted_task(), we run into trouble because what core expects from fabric handlers is different:
1) If core calls XXXX_queue_tm_rsp(), then fabric has to release one ref count only if SCF_ACK_REF is set. Otherwise it must not.
2) If core calls XXXX_aborted_task(), then fabric must not release ref count, no matter whether SCF_ACK_REF is set.

So I decided for my patch to no longer use TARGET_SCF_ACK_KREF, since then we can handle both situation the same way.
After that it was a short step to move the data fields used by the thread after wakeup() from tl_cmd to stack, because then the woken up theqard has no need to access tl_cmd, which can be freed meanwhile.

I think, the same way to fix the problem would be fine for xen also, but I'm still wondering why the thread there does not call target_put_sess_cmd, but calls transport_generic_free_cmd.

I'm wondering whether aborting an Abort ever was tested at least for these drivers.
