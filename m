Bean,

There is something odd with what your device is reporting.

We support WRITE SAME on a bunch of devices that predate the Logical
Block Provisioning VPD page and the various Block Limits parameters
being introduced to the spec. Consequently we set the provisioning mode
to "writesame_16" if the device reports LBPME=1 in READ CAPACITY(16) and
nothing relevant is reported in the VPD pages. That is by design.

If your device supports UNMAP it *must* report it in the Logical Block
Provisioning VPD by setting LBPU=1 and report MAXIMUM UNMAP LBA COUNT
and MAXIMUM UNMAP BLOCK DESCRIPTOR COUNT in the Block Limits VPD.

Also, "no_write_same" disables attempting to use WRITE SAME to zero
block ranges. That's orthogonal to the logic controlling which command
to use for performing an unmap operation. An unfortunate choice of
naming which can be attributed to the SCSI protocol using the WRITE SAME
command for two completely different operations.
