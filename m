These new ioctls are developed to manage our raid controller by our
private tools, which has no sg device. so SG_IO cannot work for our
case.

Sounds reasonable. But after checking the directory include/uapi/scsi/,
there are only several files in it. It is expected that there should be
many files if developers follow the rule. Do you know why?

See the above.

In practice, There are several branch/versions of the driver for
different purposes, upstream version is one of them. a version number
can easily tell us where it comes from and what's the relationship
between different versions. I think that's the reason why many Linux
kernel drivers have a version number.

ok. Will use the name of developer in the next version.
