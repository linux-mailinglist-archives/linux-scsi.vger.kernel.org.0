This happened in development code that was never posted on any mailing list.
It took me a while to root-cause that issue. Hence this patch.

If anyone would add a call to scsi_eh_scmd_add() for a command for which
SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT is not set.

Calls to scsi_eh_scmd_add() for commands for which SCMD_STATE_COMPLETE has
been set are much easier to find by reviewing the code than calls for commands
for which neither SCMD_STATE_COMPLETE nor SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT have been set.

Thanks,

Bart.
