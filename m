Subject: [PATCH v3 00/20] sg: add v4 interface
Date:   Wed,  7 Aug 2019 13:42:32 +0200

This patchset extends the SCSI generic (sg) driver found in
lk 5.3 .  The sg driver has a version number which is visible
via ioctl(SG_GET_VERSION_NUM) and is bumped from 3.5.36 to
4.0.03 by this patchset. The additions and changes are
described in some detail in this long webpage:
    http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg_v40.html

Most new features described in the above webpage are not
implemented in this patchset. Features that are not included are
file descriptor sharing, request sharing, multiple requests (in
one invocation) and the extended ioctl(). A later patchset may add
those features. The SG_IOSUMIT, SG_IOSUBMIT_V3, SG_IORECEIVE and
SG_IORECEIVE_V3 ioctls are added in this patchset.

Testing:
The sg3_utils package has several extensions in sg3_utils-1.45 beta
(revision 829 (see http://sg.danny.cz/sg)) to support and test the
version 4 sg driver presented in this patchset.
The new and revised testing utilities are outlined on the
same webpage as above in the second half of the section
titled: "15 Downloads and testing".

This patchset is against Martin Petersen's 5.4/scsi-queue branch.
To apply this patchset to lk 5.2 and earlier, the
ktime_get_boottime_ns() call needs to be changed back to
ktime_get_boot_ns().

Changes since v2 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20190727):
  - address issues "Reported-by: kbuild test robot <lkp@intel.com>".
    The main one was to change the bsg header included to:
    include/uapi/linux/bsg.h rather than include/linux/bsg.h
  - address some of the review comments from Hannes Reinecke;
    email responses have been sent for review comments that
    did not result in code changes

Changes since v1 (sent to linux-scsi list on 20190616):
  - change ktime_get_boot_ns() to ktime_get_boottime_ns() to reflect
    kernel API change first seen in lk 5.3.0-rc1
