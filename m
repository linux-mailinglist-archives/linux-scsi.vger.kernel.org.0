*As I understand*, splitting the tagset has issues with dual-mode HBAs - 
as in supporting NVMe and SCSI, as some HBAs do.

We are testing further, and I will tentatively say that we're getting 
better results (than previously) after fixing something in the LLDD. TBC.

Yeah, the comment reads that it's going away, but it's actually gone.

ok, thanks. I assume that we're still open to not adding support for 
global tags in blk-mq, but rather the LLDD generating the unique tag 
with sbitmap.

Cheers,
