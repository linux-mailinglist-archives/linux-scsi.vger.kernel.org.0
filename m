In theory this sounds reasonable, but without being able to test with a
real hardware I would be concerned about making this change.

Well, my only test machine with a legacy PCI slot died some time back. I
have been working on putting together a replacement and have now been
able to get a working machine with a BT-950 adapter. I have not seen
issue with trailing allocation upto 5.12-rc8. I am going to try the top
of tree as well to make sure I do not run into this issue.
