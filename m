Ditto for me. At the time I did relay my frustration to Matthew who did
address it in the documentation. Another one is that xa_find*() requires the
XA_PRESENT mark, even when you are not using marks (or haven't yet learnt
about them ...). A clearer demarcation of the two xarray modes (i.e. either
the user supplies the index, or xarray does) would be helpful. That mode
impacts which parts of the xarray interface are used, for example in the sg
driver rewrite, xarrays are used for all collections but if memory serves,
there isn't a single xa_load() or xa_store() call.

But writing technical documentation is difficult. Very few third parties step
up to help, leaving the designer/implementer to do it. And it is extremely
difficult for someone who knows the code backwards (and where the skeletons are
buried) to stand on their heads and present the information in a pedagogic
manner.

Also traditional code documentation uses 7 bit ASCII text and "ACSII art" in
a sort of nod to earlier generations of programmers. Surely more modern
techniques, including colour diagrams and even animations, should now be
encouraged. Maybe when compilers start accepting html :-)
