As I mentioned, the issue is that my patchset to add eMMC inline encryption
support (https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210121090140.326380-1-ebiggers@kernel.org)
depends on devm_blk_ksm_init(), as it was requested during review.

So if devm_blk_ksm_init() goes in through the block tree, Ulf won't be able to
take the eMMC patchset for 5.12.
