So far we've mitigated the security threat by withdrawing the v4
r/w interface which you don't use and keeping the sg nodes root only
for v3 r/w.  Unless we get another security incident based on them, as
long as the use case doesn't expand, I think the prior issue is pretty
nasty but contained to root who should know what they're doing, so
there's no pressing need to remove it.

Given that shifting to ioctls or a different async interface would be
development anyway, is there a solid reason you couldn't also shift to
v4 if you do that?  I know all the field names changed but for a
standard SCSI command it should be very similar to v3.
