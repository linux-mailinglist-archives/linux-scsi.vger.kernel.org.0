It's actually a bit more involved.

The biggest issue is that the SCSI layer is littered with the assumption
that there _will_ be a ->device pointer in struct scsi_cmnd.
If we make up a scsi_cmnd structure _without_ that we'll have to audit
the entire stack to ensure we're not tripping over a NULL device pointer.
And to make matters worse, we also need to audit the completion path in
the driver, which typically have the same 'issue'.

Case in point:

# git grep -- '->device' drivers/scsi | wc --lines
2712

Which was the primary reason for adding a stub device to the SCSI Host;
simply to avoid all the pointless churn and have a valid device for all
commands.

The only way I can see how to avoid getting dragged down into that
rat-hole is to _not_ returning a scsi_cmnd, but rather something else
entirely; that's the avenue I've exploited with my last patchset which
would just return a tag number.
But as there are drivers which really need a scsi_cmnd I can't se how we
can get away with not having a stub scsi_device for the scsi host.

And that won't even show up in sysfs if we assign it a LUN number beyond
the addressable range; 'max_id':0 tends to be a safe choice here.

Cheers,

Hannes
