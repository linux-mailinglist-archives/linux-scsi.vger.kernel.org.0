We already received a report of such issue, a while back. But being busy with
other things, it fell through the cracks.

Note that the issue is not just for passthrough commands, but rather for
commands which trigger ap->ops->qc_defer() returning true, that is (most of the
time) a non-NCQ command issued while NCQ commands are on-going. It just happen
that most pasthrough commands are non-NCQ.

I think it is time to address this command starvation issue...

Yes, we need to remember the fact that a deferred command exists/was issued. But
that is not trivial to handle unless we introduce a workqueue in libata that
handle these, draining the queue when needed. But that would mean that we keep
on hand commands that are not being issued, which is something that the block
layer better handles (with a requeue).

So in the end, I think that the better solution is to look at the scsi & block
layers requeue path for deferred commands and make sure that these commands are
at the head of the dispatch queue, always, to ensure that the next time they are
issued, they are issued first and will eventually get a chance to run once all
on-going requests complete.

Let me see with Niklas how we can handle this. We'll send something soon.
