Hi Sumit,

OK, I have a rough idea of the concept. And again I'd say megaraid sas 
may not be a good candidate to expose > 1 HW queues, as we hide HW 
queues and don't maintain the symmetry with blk-mq layer.

Indeed, I do not even expect a performance increase in exposing > 1 HW 
queues since the driver already uses the reply map + managed interrupts.

The main reason for that change in some drivers - apart from losing the 
duplicated ugliness of the reply map - is to leverage the blk-mq feature 
to drain a hctx for CPU hotplug [0] - is this something which megaraid 
sas is vulnerable to and would benefit from?

Thanks,
John
