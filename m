I don't know the depth of the SCSI or FC protocol, but storage systems
typically signal such events, maybe either via some unit attention or some FC
event. Older kernels logged that there was a change, but a manual SCSI bus scan
is needed, while newer kernels find new devices "automagically" for some
products. The HP EVA 6000 series wored that way, a 3PAR SotorServ 8000 series
also seems to work that way, but not Pure Storage X70 R3. FOr the latter you
need something like a FC LIP to make the kernel detect the new devices (LUNs).
I'm unsure where the problem is, but in principle the kernel can be
notified...

Talking of VPDs: Somewhere in the last 12 years (within SLES 11)there was a
kernel change regarding trailing blanks in VPD data. That change blew up
several configurations being unable to re-recognize the devices. In one case
the software even had bound a license to a specific device with serial number,
and that software found "new" devices while missing the "old" ones...
