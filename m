The standard monks defined it as conceptually easy: if a command completes
with success and sense data available bit set, then just read that log
page that has the sense data to check what happened. Very trivial in
principle.
But of course, this is ATA, so a mess in practice because we want to do
that read log with an NCQ command to less impact on the drive performance
than a regular error. Otherwise, if we simply do a regular eh, we end up
with the same impact as a hard command failure. And then we end up with
all these problems with tag reusing and nothing in libata allowing to do
internal ncq commands.

Yep. This is a 1024B log which has all the sense information of for all
completed NCQ commands, organized per tag.

> Q1: Can we (re-) use that tag to read the log information?

I thought of that. BUT: if a revalidate or regular eh is ongoing, we need
to delay issuing of the NCQ read log command since eh will prevent issuing
anything (there will be non-ncq commands on-going). Problem here is that
delaying ncq commands means essentially doing a requeue so we need a real
req/scsi req for that. Reusing the tag for a new temporary internal qc is
not enough.

> Q2: What do you do if all 32 command generate such an error?

For that case, I can simply use the internal tag and do a non-ncq read
log. That is actually the easy case !

I am exploring the reuse of the scsi EH now. But very messy on libata
side. Still no good solution.

While doing that, I did discover that libata eh is very messy because of
one driver only: scsi ipr. That is the only one that does not have a
->error_handler port operation. And because of that, we are stuck with
lots of "old EH" ata code. So there are always 2 different eh path.
Complete mess. I am trying to see if I can't convert scsi ipr to have a
error_handler port operation, but I cannot test anything as I do not have
the hardware.
