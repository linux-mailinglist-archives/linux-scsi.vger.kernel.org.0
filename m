I'll wait a bit for full dmesg output and/or bisecting. When I initially re=
ad
the bug report, ericspero seemed to do a pretty good job of bisecting the
change.

It seems that we still don't agree that libata is responsible for the newly
introduced lack of mouse pointer interactivity following resume. Therefore,=
 I
will spend some more time characterizing the problem. I have a relatively n=
ew
Chuwi laptop with a spare m.2/sata slot. I've ordered an m.2/sata to sata 7=
 pin
adapter so that I can plug a sata hard drive into this machine. As far as I=
 can
find, this type of adapter is only available directly from China so it will
take a couple of weeks to get them. I'll post the results then. If I can mu=
ster
to two machines as orthogonal as I can make them both exhibiting the same
problem, perhaps we might come together. Or perhaps the Chuwi machine won't
exhibit the problem and I'll have to rethink.

One other observation. It seems to me that libata maintainers should have a
machine containing a spinning disk at their disposal. I have a bunch of spa=
re
machines with hard drives and would be amenable to donating one for this
purpose. Also, in case you are interested, the previously described m.2/sat=
a to
7pin sata adapter is available on eBay at:
