One invariant is that the polling will be kept as running until the
associated iocb/bio is completed. So I understand it should be fine
for timeout handler /EH to ignore REQ_HIPRI. That said the associated
iocb/bio will be reaped by upper layer if EH/timeout handler makes
progress. Or can you explain the scsi-debug REQ_HIPRI lockup in a bit
detail?
