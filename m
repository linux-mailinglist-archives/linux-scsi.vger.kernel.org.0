Dear Friend,

I'm sorry but happy to inform you about my success in getting those
funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Vietnam,
though I tried my best to involve you in the business but God decided
the whole situations. Presently I=E2=80=99m in Vietnam for investment proje=
cts
with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I didn't forget your
past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds
despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary in Burkina Faso her name is Ms. Chantal
Davids on her e-mail address below (davidschantal90@gmail.com) ask her
to send you the total of $1.450,000.00 (One million four hundred and
fifty thousand united state of America dollars) which I kept for your
compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in
this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So
feel free and get in touched with my secretary Ms. Chantal Davids and
instruct her where to send the amount to you. Please do let me know
immediately you receive it so that we can share joy after all the
sufferness at that time.

In the moment, I=E2=80=99m very busy here because of the investment project=
s
which I and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remember that
I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive
that money, so feel free to get in touch with Ms. Chantal Davids she
will send the amount to you without any delay OK. Extend my greetings
to your family.

My Best regards

Yours brother
Dr. Abu Salam
Greetings from Vietnam.
