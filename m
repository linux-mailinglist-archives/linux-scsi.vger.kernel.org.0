That's not a workable approach in general.  For example, you wouldn't 
want to eject a CD just because it hadn't been used for a couple of 
minutes and the drive was therefore about to be suspended.

Agreed.

The difficulty is recognizing situations where the media really was 
changed while the device was suspended.  Most devices, AFAIK, don't have 
any problem with this, but card readers often do.

I suppose the kernel could just rely on users not to change media in 
drives while they are mounted.  Then any problems that arise would be 
the users' fault.  Yes, this is nothing more than passing the buck, but 
it's hard to come up with any better approach.  Doesn't Windows do 
something like this?
