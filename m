The "=" are from the patch below which is in v5.10-rc2

commit 54a19b4d3fe0fa0a31b46cd60951e8177cac25fa
Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+huawei@kernel.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 30 08:40:50 2020 +0100

    docs: ABI: cleanup several ABI documents
    
    There are some ABI documents that, while they don't generate
    any warnings, they have issues when parsed by get_abi.pl script
    on its output result.
    
    Address them, in order to provide a clean output.
