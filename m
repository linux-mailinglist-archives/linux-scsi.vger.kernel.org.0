Actually I want to half take this last chunk back. When I said in general these calls
seem useful, I meant for the mlx5_vdpa_set_vq_ready type design. For example, if a
user was going to remove/add vCPUs then this functionality where we are completely
adding/removing virtqueues would be useful. We would need a lot more than just
the new ioctl though, because we would want to completely create/setup a new
virtqueue

I do not have any of our users asking for this. You guys work on this more so
you know better.

Another option is to kick it down the road again since I'm not sure my patches
here have a lot to do with this. We could also just do the kernel only approach
(no new ioctl) and then add some new design when we have users asking for it.
