With the added benefit of ioctl(SG_GET_NUM_WAITING) becoming O(1).
I clocked it an 500 nanoseconds per invocation on my laptop.

Loses the "likely", doesn't compile, and is logically wrong.
Brown paper bag :-)


And this is getting beyond a joke. I have had to repeatedly rebuild
dev kernels because:
    1) Torvalds forces Martin to use buggy "rc1" kernels in his
       scsi-queue branches, and
    2) in lk 5.3-rc1 there is your snafu in scsi_lib.c

Please go light on such "optimizations".
