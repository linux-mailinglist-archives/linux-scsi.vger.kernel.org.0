You may already be aware of this, but in case you aren't...

The PM core already contains some provisions for handling these kinds
of things.  They are described in
Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst.  See particularly the parts
relating to the DPM_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE, DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE,
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND, DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME, and
power.direct_complete flags.

A follow-up patch after this series might be able to take advantage of
these facilities.
