No, blk_poll() actually poll for bio's completion instead of request's
completion. If the submitted HIPRI bio isn't completed, the polling won't be
stopped.

blk_poll() doesn't care request requeue, what matters is that if the HIPRI
bio is completed or not.

So either timeout or EH codes needn't to handle HIPRI IO specially.
