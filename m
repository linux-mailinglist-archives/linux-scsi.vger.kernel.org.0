hdparm -Y does not use the kernel power management core. There is a hack in
libata to track that a SLEEP command was issued to the device and then mark it
with ATA_DFLAG_SLEEPING. And if this flag is set, then the port is reset to
spinup the drive whenever a new command is received. That is what is causing the
problem here as a reset (EH running) is not supposed to happen when the scsi
drive is going away.

This all boils down to the scsi disk not being in sync with its underlying ata
device: the scsi disk is not marked as spun-down/standby and so a flush cache is
issued. Problem is that it is not realistic to track and maintain the system
device state by catching/parsing passthrough commands such as issued by hdparm.

That said, a hang is still not acceptable. we will see how to avoid it (it is
not trivial).

Removing a scsi disk will remove and put the backing ata device in standby
state. So you do not need to do that manually. Remove that "hdparm -Y" from your
script.
