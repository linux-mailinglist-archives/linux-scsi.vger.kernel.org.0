You won't race init stuff with rmmod, the issue comes up *after* the device=
 is
up, once init completes.

Right, try installing multipath too, which is a a busy nosy neighbor who ju=
st
loves too poke at devices when they pop up as well.

No, the piece of information you are likely missing is that rmmod does a sa=
nity
check in userspace on the refcnt before trying to call the system call to t=
ry
to remove the module. That refcnt is what userspace modprobe is bailing on.

A refcnt is always held on init, and so rmmod cannot possibly done on init.=
 The
races we are observing is not something on init and rmmod... its *after* in=
it,
and then rmmod not being able to complete. Why? Because we allow for it.

No. try_module_get() is best effort, in the sense that if the module is not
being removed yet, and it succeeds in getting a reference, rmmod will be
prevented from removing the module unput we put the module later. If
try_module_get() failed, we can safely assume the module is gone out fishin=
g.

The idea here is to call a busy syfs file which will not return until all
devices are removed *and* it also locks the driver to not allow any new
entries, therefore making the driver useful for new additions. That requires
adding a small state machine. The reason I am thinking this would be needed=
, is
that as in the patches with zram you'll see there are possible races also w=
ith
module removal and sysfs files. So if we really want to *quiesce* this driv=
er,
for removal, we need to ensure that no new sysfs entries will busy out while
rmmod is going on.

It should appear right away if we attach sysfs stuff prior to the devices w=
hich
probe asynchronously.
