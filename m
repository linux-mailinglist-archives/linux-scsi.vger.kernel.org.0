I fail to see the benefit of this as both have roughly the same meaning; =
if you have ALUA unavailable you can't access the device, hence it's =
completely irrelevant what PQ says. And same for the other way round: if =
PQ=3D1 is set really the only ALUA state which makes sense is =
'unavailable'.

What about something like this? This will remove the device if the PQ=3D1 =
and re-discover it. If the TPG
remains unavailable, it will just be created in the same way. If the TPG =
has moved to an active state
the newly created device will be an available sd device. This way at =
least target vendors can cause
the initiator to rescan and get the devices from unavailable to an =
active state without the manual
Intervention on each host having to remove the devices with the PQ=3D1 =
set and rescan manually.
If the manual removal of devices is required, it does make ALUA =
unavailable unrealistic.
