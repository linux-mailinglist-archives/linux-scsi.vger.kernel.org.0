Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

This afaics is a reasonable request for 6.1, as this seems to be
(Salvatore, please correct me if I'm wrong) a regression caused by
0e0747de0ea3 ("scsi: mpt3sas: Fix return value check of
dma_get_required_mask()"), which was merged for 6.0-rc7. Hence allow me
to ask:

Sreekanth and Martin, is there a reason why this request (and the
earlier one a month ago) was apparently met with silence? Or was
progress made in between and I just missed it?

Salvatore, for 5.10 things are a bit more complicated, as someone would
need to do the work. Sometimes that work is done by the driver
developers and maintainers as well, but strictly speaking it's the duty
of those that backported the change to 5.10.y. Didn't check who did that
this case (the stable team?); but well, maybe let's sort this out for
6.1.y first.
