 With my new server in place I can experiment more with the old one, so I 
have decided to upgrade it from venerable 2.6.18 and give your change a 
try with the BT-958 to verify it does not cause a regression, but there is 
something wrong even without it:

and obviously the system does not complete booting (root is on /dev/sda2).  
I'll see if I can bisect the problem and report back.  I don't have a 
FlashPoint adapter to verify that part of the driver, but I guess for your 
change alone a MultiMaster one such as mine will suffice.

 Also `pr_cont' has not been applied here when `printk' handling was 
reworked causing messy output, so I'll fix it too on this occasion.

 Last but not least I do hope you do not plan to retire ISA DMA bounce 
buffering support for drivers/block/floppy.c, as there is hardly an 
alternative available (I do have a single SCSI<->FDD interface built 
around an Intel 8080 CPU, in the half-height 5.25" drive form factor, but 
such devices are exceedingly rare, and then you need a suitable parallel 
SCSI host too).

 Would it be feasible to convert it and any other drivers for ISA DMA 
devices (like those support for which you propose to remove here) still 
have users who could verify operation to the IOMMU framework?
