I just got some feedbacks from other flash vendors, they all commit that
their devices can work well in this scenario [1]. Some of them proposed
even complicated (maybe better) principles of handling the "HPB reset",
but since the device works well in [1], I am OK with current (simpler)
handling of "HPB reset" - in device mode doing nothing, in host mode
re-activate regions that host is trying to do a read to.
