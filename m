  * Add in qdepth limit check to limit outstanding commands.
    to the max values supported by the controller.
  * Correct some minor issues found during regression testing.
  * Update the driver version.

    Reported-by: kernel test robot <lkp@intel.com>
    https://lists.01.org/hyperkitty/list/kbuild-all@lists.01.org/thread/ZCXJJDGPPTTXLZCSCGWEY6VXPRB3IFOQ/

Changes since V3:
    Martin Wilck's Review:
    smartpqi-add-support-for-product-id
      * Moved a formatting HUNK to smartpqi-align-code-with-oob-driver
      * Added more patch description detail.
    smartpqi-refactor-aio-submission-code
      * Updated patch description.
    smartpqi-add-support-for-raid5-and-raid6-writes
      * Removed two manifest constants from smartpqi.h
      * Changed scnprintf format from %hhx to %x for sysfs entries:
          pqi_host_enable_r5_writes_show:ctrl_info->enable_r5_writes
          pqi_host_enable_r6_writes_show:ctrl_info->enable_r6_writes
      * Corrected disabling of R1 reads
      * Added comment on raid_map calculations.
        Changed how parity indexes are calculated.
      * Changed DMA direction in function pqi_aio_submit_r56_write_io
        to DMA_TO_DEVICE.
    smartpqi-add-support-for-raid1-writes
      * Changed DMA direction in function pqi_aio_submit_r1_write_io
        to DMA_TO_DEVICE.
    smartpqi-add-support-for-BMIC-sense-feature-cmd-and-feature-bits
      * Squashed smartpqi-update-AIO-Sub-Page-0x02-support
        This effectively moved function pqi_aio_limit_to_bytes into this patch.
      * Squashed smartpqi-enable-support-for-NVMe-encryption since
        this was adding in another feature.
      * Moved formatting HUNK for pqi_scsi_dev_raid_map_data into
        smartpqi-refactor-aio-submission-code.
      * Moved structure pqi_aio_r56_path_request formatting HUNKS into
        smartpqi-add-support-for-raid5-and-raid6-writes.
      * Moved remaining formatting HUNKs into
        smartpqi-align-code-with-oob-driver.
    smartpqi-add-support-for-long-firmware-version
      * Updated setting of ctrl_info->firmware_version to avoid overflows.
      * Moved a formatting HUNK into smartpqi-align-code-with-oob-driver.
    smartpqi-align-code-with-oob-driver
      * Updated with formatting HUNKs in other reviews.
    smartpqi-add-stream-detection
      * Updated patch description to better describe what the patch does.
    smartpqi-add-host-level-stream-detection-enable
      * Changed snprintf formate from 0x%hhx to 0x%x.
    smartpqi-enable-support-for-NVMe-encryption
      * Squashed into patch
        smartpqi-add-support-for-BMIC-sense-feature-cmd-and-feature-bits
    smartpqi-fix-driver-synchronization-issues
      * Split into 10 patches.
        smartpqi-remove-timeouts-from-internal-cmds
        smartpqi-add-support-for-wwid
        smartpqi-update-event-handler
        smartpqi-update-soft-reset-management-for-OFA
          * Squashed smartpqi-change-timing-of-release-of-QRM-memory-during-OFA
        smartpqi-synchronize-device-resets-with-mutex
          * Note: still using mutex. Our OOB driver has been well tested with
                  this synchronization construct. Changing this here will
                  mandate a change in our OOB driver and kick off another
                  round of regression tests that have already passed.
        smartpqi-update-suspend-resume-and-shutdown
          * Note: suspend/resume is not supported on many servers. This
                  has passed our internal tests on the few that do. This
                  patch was originally intended for a workstation platform.
                  So I left the mutex code alone. We would like to address any
                  subsequent issues in the future.
        smartpqi-update-raid-bypass-handling
        smartpqi-update-ofa-management
          * Squashed smartpqi-return-busy-indication-for-IOCTLs-when-ofa-is-active
        smartpqi-update-device-scan-operations
        smartpqi-fix-driver-synchronization-issues
          * Original patch with all un-related HUNKs moved into the above
            9 patches.
    smartpqi-fix_host_qdepth_limit
      * Patch removed and replaced with patch smartpqi-use-host-wide-tagspace
    smartpqi-change-timing-of-release-of-QRM-memory-during-OFA
      * Squashed into patch smartpqi-update-soft-reset-management-for-OFA
    smartpqi-add-additional-logging-for-LUN-resets
      * Updated patch description
    smartpqi-update-enclosure-identifier-in-sysfs
      * Updated patch description.
    smartpqi-correct-system-hangs-when-resuming-from-hibernation
      * Updated patch description.
      * Note: suspend/resume is not widely supported. The platform this
              patch was added for was a workstation. There has been a lot
              of testing on the supported platforms and all of the tests
              have passed. We would rather not make changes to this patch
              because of the rare usage. We would rather correct any issues
              (if any) in subsequent patches.
    smartpqi-update-version-to-2.1.8-045
      * Previous patch was smartpqi-update-version-to-2.1.6-005
        We bumped the version up since the patch set was originally pushed.
