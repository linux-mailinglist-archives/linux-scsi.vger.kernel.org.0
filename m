Merging thread with Bart.

Hi Bart - Yes this was tested with this series pulled in.
I'm on 5.10.9.

Thanks Alan.
I've tried to summarize below the problem that I'm seeing.

Problem:
There's a deadlock seen in ufs's runtime-suspend path.
Currently, the wlun's are registered to request based blk-pm.
During ufs pltform-dev runtime-suspend cb, as per protocol needs,
it sends a few cmds (uac, ssu) to wlun.

In this path, it tries to resume the ufs platform device which is actually
suspending and deadlocks.

Yes, if the host doesn't send any commands during it's suspend there wouldn't be
this deadlock.
Setting manage_start_stop would send ssu only.
I can't seem to find a way to send cmds to wlun during it's suspend.
Would overriding sd_pm_ops for wlun be a good idea?
Do you've any other pointers on how to do this?
I'd appreciate any pointers.
