Great, thanks.

This is exactly what I meant, just wanted to ensure it wasn't the poor mans
edition that we've seen before, we're IRQs are still triggered and you end
up getting completions from both manual finding via the poll hook, and from
the "normal" side. Because that kind of sucks.

What you have sounds exactly how it should be, both in terms of functionality
and implementation. Thanks for confirming!

Guess I need to take another look at the shared host tag set support, see if
we an get that in for 5.10.
