ok - but that didn't address what I said.  As defined right now, 
"hba_process" means "if set to 0, mark port state MARGINAL. if set 
non-zero, ignore".  There is no validation of what type of FPIN, etc.

Given "hba_process" is ambigous, I think you should change that name to 
"info_only" or "log_only" or something similar - e.g. what we want to 
communicate is the following: normally fpin_rcv is normally called with 
this flag set to false and that the transport or daemon can act on the 
event.  But the new flag, when true, should only log or display the 
event but not act on it.

>> However, we currently leave the decision of marginality to be determined and managed by the external daemon that processes the fpin events. So the patch needs to expand the fpin event to include the driver processed flag in the event data. Please add this to >fc_host_post_fc_event().

Currently the daemon is the only thing in existence and it was only 
recently added.  When the functionality goes into the kernel, we can 
adapt anything then. What does not make sense is immediately changing 
state as of an (any) FPIN receive.

Regardless - to support the deamon and as "log only or not" is 
meaningful, please add it to the event.
