Cache flushes do not matter that much when SSDs and sudden power cuts
are involved.  Power cuts at the wrong time harm the FLASH itself, it is
not about still-in-flight data.

Keep in mind that SSDs do a _lot_ of background writing, and power cuts
during a FLASH write or erase can cause from weakened cells, to much
larger damage.  It is possible to harden the chip or the design against
this, but it is *expensive*.  And even if warded off by hardening and no
FLASH damage happens, an erase/program cycle must be done on the whole
erase block to clean up the incomplete program cycle.

Due to this background activity, an unexpected power cut could damage
data *anywhere* in an SSD: it could hit some filesystem area that was
being scrubbed in background by the SSD, or internal SSD metadata.

So, you want that SSD to know it must be quiescent-for-poweroff for
*real* before you allow the system to do anything that could power it
off.

And, as I have found out the hard way years ago, you also want to give
the SSD enough *extra* time to actually quiesce, even if it claims to be
already prepared for poweroff [1].

When you do not follow these rules, well, excellent datacenter-class
SSDs have super-capacitor power banks that actually work.  Most SSDs do
not, although they hopefully came a long way and hopefully modern SSDs
are not as easily to brick as they were reported to be three or four
years ago.


[1] I have long lost the will and energy to pursue this, so *this* is a
throw-away anecdote for anyone that cares: I reported here a few years
ago that many models of *SATA* based SSDs from Crucial/Micron, Samsung
and Intel were complaining (through their SMART attributes) that Linux
was causing unsafe shutdowns.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/4/10/1181

TL;DR: wait one *extra* second after the SSD acknowleged the STOP
command as complete before you trust the SSD device is safe to be
powered down (i.e. before reboot, suspend, poweroff/shutdown, and device
removal/detach).  This worked around the issue for every vendor and
model of SSD we tested.
