The GPU related messages are unrelated to ATA subsystem. Obviously, libata =
does
not attempt to use the GPU for anything :) Restarting of tasks being differ=
ed
until the hdd spins up is also normal. hdd spinning up and then starting
responding to commands is part of the normal resume process and tasks will =
be
resumed only after the kernel has finished resuming all devices. Resuming of
devices is asynchronous and devices that are unrelated can be resumed
simultaneously. So I am not sure why it seems that your GPU and mouse resum=
ing
is delaying only after the HDD spin up. Note that this change to asynchrono=
us
resume did cause some issues with ata/scsi (see below).

Having the drive sleep when unused can be achieved using power state timers
setting on the drive itself. Resume is different: the kernel must ensure th=
at
the device that was there before suspend is still here, and in the case of
storage, that the device is still the same. This is necessary to avoid issu=
es
with file system (that will resume later) and also with tasks that were doi=
ng
IOs when the system was suspended. If file systems or tasks were resumed
without the storage device ready and checked first, all sorts of bad things=
 can
happen.

Note that commit 6aa0365a3c85 ("ata: libata-scsi: Avoid deadlock on rescan
after device resume") was added to kernel 6.4 (at rc7) to fix another issue
with resume: a hard hang (not a delay). This patch synchronizes scsi and ata
resume by having scsi resume wait for ata resume to complete, which means
waiting for the device re-scan to complete. And that in turn means that the=
 HDD
must complete spin up first.
