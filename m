That wouldn't make any difference.  The information sent by your card 
reader has sshdr.asc == 0x28 and sshdr.ascq == 0x00 (you can see it in 
the log).  So because of the code here in scsi_check_sense(), which you 
can't change, the Unit Attention sent by the card reader would not be 
retried even if you do set the flag in resume().
