Actually, the behaviour of num_possible_cpus() under cpu hotplug seems 
to be implementation-specific.
One might want to set it to the max value at all times, which has the 
drawback that you'd need to scale per-cpu values with that number, 
leading to a massive memory overhead as only very few installation will 
ever reach that number.
Others might want to set to the max value at the current configuration, 
implying that it might change under CPU hotplug.
Which seems to be the case for PowerPC, which was the case which 
triggered the issue at hand.
But maybe it was a plain bug in the CPU hotplug implementation; one 
should be asking BenH for details here.

Cheers,

Hannes
