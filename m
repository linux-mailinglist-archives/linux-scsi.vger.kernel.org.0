The first 9 patches of this series fix several issues with suspend/resume
power management operations in scsi and libata. The most significant
changes introduced are in patch 4 and 5, where the manage_start_stop
flag of scsi devices is split into the manage_system_start_stop and
manage_runtime_start_stop flags to allow keeping scsi runtime power
operations for spining up/down ATA devices but have libata do its own
system suspend/resume device power state management using EH.

The remaining patches are code cleanup that do not introduce any
significant functional change.

This series was tested on qemu and on various PCs and servers. I am
CC-ing people who recently reported issues with suspend/resume.
Additional testing would be much appreciated.

Changes from v6:
 * Changed patch 9 to use a bool for the new suspended flag.

Changes from v5:
 * Typo and style corrections in patch 4 commit message
 * Changed patch 9 to use a new flag to track a disk suspended state
   instead of using the scsi device state
 * Added review tags

Changes from v4:
 * Remove ata_scsi_dev_alloc() function in patch 3, coding it directly
   in ata_scsi_slave_alloc()
 * Correct typo in patch 19 commit message
 * Added Tested and review tags

Changes from v3:
 * Corrected patch 1 (typo in commit message and WARN_ON() removal)
 * Changed path 3 as suggested by Niklas (moved definition of
   ->slave_alloc)
 * Rebased on rc2
 * Added review tags

Changes from v2:
 * Added patch 4 as simply disabling manage_start_stop from libata was
   breaking individual disk runtime suspend/autosuspend. Patch 5 was
   reworked accordingly to the changes in patch 4.
 * Fixed patch 3: applying the link creation was missing and the link
   creation itself was also incorrect, preventing sd probe to execute
   correctly. Thanks to Geert for testing and reporting this issue.
 * Split the "Fix delayed scsi_rescan_device() execution" patch into
   patch 6 (scsi part) and patch 7 (ata part).
 * Modified patch 9 to not call sd_shutdown() from sd_remove() for
   devices that are not running.
 * Added Chia-Lin Tested tag to unchanged patches

Changes from v1:
 * Added patch 8 and 9 to fix compilation warnings with W=1
 * Addressed John comment in patch 19
 * Fixed patch 20 commit message (Sergei)
 * Added Hannes Review tag
