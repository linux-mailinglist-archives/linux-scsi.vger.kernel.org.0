Very Urgent

May the peace of God be with you

I am glad to know you, but God knows you better and he knows why he
has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be surprised at
all. My name is Mrs.Lila Lucas, a widow, i have been suffering from
ovarian cancer disease. At this moment i am about to end the race like
this because the illness has gotten to a very bad stage, without any
family members and no child. I hope that you will not expose or betray
this trust and confidence that I am about to entrust to you for the
mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileged ones. I have
some funds I inherited from my late husband,the sum of ($11.000.000
Eleven million dollars.) deposited in the Bank. Having known my
present health status, I decided to entrust this fund to you believing
that you will utilize it the way i am going to instruct
herein.Therefore I need you to assist me and reclaim this money and
use it for Charity works, for orphanages and giving justice and help
to the poor, needy and to promote the words of God and the effort that
the house of God will be maintained says The Lord." Jeremiah
22:15-16.=E2=80=9C

It will be my great pleasure to compensate you with 35 % percent of
the total money for your personal use, 5 % percent for any expenses
that may occur during the international transfer process while 60% of
the money will go to the charity project. All I require from you is
sincerity and the ability to complete God's task without any failure.
It will be my pleasure to see that the bank has finally released and
transferred the fund into your bank account therein your country even
before I die here in the hospital, because of my present health status
everything needs to be processed rapidly as soon as possible. Please
kindly respond quickly. Thanks and God bless you,

May God Bless you for your kind help.
Yours sincerely sister Mrs. Lila Lucas.
