ok, understood.

But is there a change which you can share for me to test locally?

In the test for enabling, above *, I just locally removed the 
ioc->is_gen35_ioc condition and it looks to work ok. Is this good 
enough, or am I possibly doing something dangerous? I'd appreciate if 
you can share something for me to try locally.

Thanks,
John
