Hi Avri,

It is not reverting Bart's change, but making TMR work properly based
on it. I am ok with the Bart's idea of getting a tag for TMR from
blk_get_request(), and this patch respects that idea.

Thanks for the suggestion. I treat it as a whole because it is 
convenient
for me to get it ported and tested over different platforms. I may
revise it in next version after more comments come on it.

Thanks,
