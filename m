In fact, even the traces where the file doesn't exist beforehand show 
some delays.  Just not as many delays as the traces where the file does 
exist.  And again, each delay is in the middle of a write command, not 
between commands.

I suppose changes to the upper software layers could affect which
blocks are assigned when a new file is written.  Perhaps one kernel
re-uses the same old blocks that had been previously occupied and the
other kernel allocates a completely new set of blocks.  That might
change the drive's behavior.  The quick way to tell is to record two
usbmon traces, one under the "good" kernel and one under the "bad"  
kernel, where each test involves writing over a file that already
exists (say, 50 MB) -- the same file for both tests.  The block numbers
will appear in the traces.

Also, I wonder if the changing the size of the data transfers would
make any difference.  This is easy to try; just write "64" to
/sys/block/sd?/queue/max_sectors_kb (where the ? is the appropriate
drive letter) after the drive is plugged in but before the test starts.
