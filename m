Right, this can happen. Actually, this can happen even without my
patch if the scan can occur between scsi_remove_device() in
tcm_loop_port_unlink() and core_tpg_remove_lun(), right?

I presumed we need to use some lock around here. I digged around the
code but cannot figure out a suitable lock here. Actually, I tried
(struct Scsi_Host)->scan_mutex, but it didn't work.

Or, we should block tcm_loop_queuecommand() to proceed the INQUIRY
commads on this LUN? move/introduce new hook after
transport_clear_lun_ref(lun)?

Any idea?
