Hi,

My name is Abey Wilton, I head the Accounts Department of L. F. H. London, United Kingdom. I am also in charge of the Audit and Financial Records Unit of the above establishment.

I urgently need someone who can work with me to carry out a proposal that will be of financial benefit to the both of us and I believe you are well placed to partner with me. I assure you that everything will work out well with me on this other side doing my own part of it.


Kindly write back to me if you are interested and want more details on how we can proceed.

Abey Wilton

L. F. H. London, UK.
