alloc_iova_fast() will already clear out the caches if space is running 
low, so the caching itself shouldn't be an issue.

I meant we can't increase the caching threshold as-is once the domain is 
in use, because that could result in odd-sized IOVAs previously 
allocated above the old threshold being later freed back into caches, 
then causing havoc the next time they get allocated (because they're not 
as big as the actual size being asked for). However, trying to address 
that by just size-aligning everything even above the caching threshold 
is liable to waste too much space on IOVA-constrained systems (e.g. a 
single 4K video frame may be ~35MB - rounding that up to 64MB each time 
would be hard to justify).

It follows from that that there's really no point in decoupling the 
rounding-up threshold from the actual caching threshold - you get all 
the wastage (both IOVA space and actual memory for the cache arrays) for 
no obvious benefit.

Again, I'm less convinced by Kconfig since I imagine many people tuning 
server-class systems for their own particular workloads will be running 
standard enterprise distros, so I think end-user-accessible knobs will 
be the most valuable. That's not to say that a Kconfig option to set the 
default state of a command-line option (as we do elsewhere) won't be 
useful for embedded users, cloud providers, etc., just that I'm not sure 
it's worth it being the *only* option.

Robin.
