Indeed. As per the Linux kernel Web site [1]: 5.5 and 5.9 are not 
maintained anymore (EOL) upstream. So, if distributions decided to go 
with another Linux kernel release, it’s their job to backport things. If 
the commit message is well written, and contains the Fixes tag, their 
tooling should be able to pick it up.


Kind regards,

Paul
