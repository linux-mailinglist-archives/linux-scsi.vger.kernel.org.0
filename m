That would cause trouble for the UFS driver and other drivers for which
runtime resume can fail due to e.g. the link between host and device
being in a bad state.

How about checking the SCSI device state inside scsi_rescan_device() and
skipping the rescan if the SCSI device state is SDEV_CANCEL or SDEV_DEL?

Adding such a check inside __scsi_execute() would break sd_remove() and
sd_shutdown() since both use __scsi_execute() to submit a SYNCHRONIZE
CACHE command to the device.
