This is possible but this will require careful review of at least the
following code paths such that nothing unexpected happens for internal
commands:
* The SCSI timeout code.
* All blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() and scsi_host_busy_iter() callers. As an
example, scsi_host_busy() must not include LLD-internal commands.

Thanks,

Bart.
