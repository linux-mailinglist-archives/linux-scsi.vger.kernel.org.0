Alright, I think part of the confusion is me rebasing across a
midstream branch that has some unrelated bandaid fixes in it
which have never been submitted or were last submitted in 2024.
I'll simply drop those from my boot-testing branch and do my own
thing as I see fit, because things that were never submitted
upstream aren't real and can't hurt me.

Turns out the only usage of freq-table-hz is in the examples I've added.
Mainline does not at all have any nodes in the DT right now that would
use this property.

Ergo, I think I will go for operating-points-v2. We might as well clean
this up now instead of ossifying a deprecated property in a new binding
for the sake of downstream compatibility (which should never be a concern)
that I am already breaking. The added benefit is that if we ever do get
better OPP definitions than just two clock states, then we can actually
add the OPP bandwidth properties so implementations can make informed
decisions.

Alright. I think I agree with this. I've tried to use the ufs common
supply names because I thought that was the way to go, but using the
supply names that are in the datasheets seems much more clear and
reasonable to me, as we're no longer introducing different meanings
depending on the used compatible.

It's possible that it's relying on clock states from some magic MCU
that fiddles with things. It should definitely be fixed if that's the
case.

I've just tried MT8196 with only the 13 clocks MT8195 will have once
I get to work, and it seems to probe fine an read from UFS fine.
Doesn't necessarily have to mean anything because again, a magic
MCU may be fiddling with the clock gates.

However, since the supplies of MT8195 won't be a subset of the
supplies of MT8196, I won't make it a fallback relationship.
E.g. an MT8195 device could be allowed to just have the 1.8V
supply and an MT8196 device could be allowed to just have the
1.2V/0.9V supplies, which means an implementation written against
the MT8195 binding would not work for the MT8196.

Thank you for helping to clear this whole mess up. Turns out this
was way more work than initially expected, but I reckon if I come
in like a wrecking ball right now then that will make the job easier
for everyone contributing to mainline in the future.

Kind regards,
