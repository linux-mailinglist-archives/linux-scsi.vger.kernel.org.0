Sure, I can make it a bool.

Yes, but that is not what this patch addresses.

No it will not because the commands issued in sd_shutdown() are synchronous, so
the adapter resume will wait for these to complete. But they will never complete
as the adapter itself is not fully resumed, AND the disk may not be in a state
that allows commands to be executed. Deadlock.

It is easy to recreate this issue if you have a pm8001 adapter: remove that fix
patch I sent to correctly re-allocate IRQs on resume and do a suspend-resume
cycle: on resume, the adapter fails to allocate IRQs and gives up, calling
scsi_remove_host(). The system end being stuck in resume context with no forward
progress ever made.

It seems that you are suggesting that we should use some information from the
scsi_device->power structure to detect the suspended state... But as mentioned
before, these are PM internal and should not be touched without the device lock
held. So the little "suspended" falg simplifies things a lot.
