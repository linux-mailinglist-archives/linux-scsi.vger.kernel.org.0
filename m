Please confirm that your kernel included ee8868c5c78f ("scsi:
scsi_dh_alua: Retry RTPG on a different path after failure").
That commit should cause the RTPG to be retried on other map members
which are not in failed state, thus avoiding this phenomenon.

I doubt that this is correct. If you look at the commit msg of
268940b80fa4 ("scsi: scsi_dh_alua: Return BLK_STS_AGAIN for ALUA
transitioning state"):


 "When the ALUA state indicates transitioning we should not retry the command
 immediately, but rather complete the command with BLK_STS_AGAIN to signal
 the completion handler that it might be retried.  This allows multipathing
 to redirect the command to another path if possible, and avoid stalls
 during lengthy transitioning times."

The purpose of that patch was to set the state of the transitioning
path to failed in order to make sure IO is retried on a different path.
Your patch would undermine this purpose.

Regards
Martin
