I have just checked the drive and I can now confirm that you are right
about the capabilities reported: it is indeed reporting Write Caching.

However the point is that the current kernel behaviour is wrong and
leading to data corruption on such drives, as the sync function fails
due to missing Synchronize Cache command.

Once again, this is because of very old HD specifications that were
implementing Write Caching without that command.

The way forward is to treat the command failure as non-critical (see
attached patch) because clearly it's not implemented in all drives, but
only more recent ones.
