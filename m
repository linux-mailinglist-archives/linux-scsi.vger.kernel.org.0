We got the message and we will do what we can to prevent future
regressions for USB devices.

As has been mentioned earlier, there is evidence in
sd_read_write_protect_flag() that SCSI devices may misbehave when
querying a mode page. However, I was not familiar with that code and
hence was not aware of the comments in that code. According to the git
history, these comments were added before 2005, that is before I started
reading the linux-scsi mailing list.

The new mode page has been introduced last year in SBC-5. UFS devices 
have a mix of SLC and TLC NAND internally and the new mode page allows
device vendors to reduce write amplification. This is important to UFS
device vendors.

I think that the new mode page is useful for all storage devices that
have a mix of slow and fast storage internally and hence that it is also
useful for some enterprise storage devices. This is why the new mode
page is read by default. But as has been mentioned above, we have
learned our lesson and will be much more careful in the future when
adding code that modifies the access pattern of the sd driver for USB
storage devices.

Thanks,

Bart.
