Yep exactly. This is a no-go for small embedded platforms with a single eMMC.
The device *must* be in the non-secure world, so the bootloader can load the
kernel/rootfs from the eMMC.  If you restrain that in secure world access
only, that complicates things a lot ...

As for the EFI that was mentioned earlier, newer Arm devices and the
standardization behind those, is actually trying to use UEFI on most
of the platforms.  FWIW we already have code that manages the EFI variables in
the RPMB (which is kind of irrelevant to the current discussion, just giving
people a heads up).
