All write commands are optional in SBC.

When scanning the drive, you need to poke it using scsi_report_opcode() to
determine which write operation is supported. Then sd.c need to be modified to
generate the proper write command if the regular WRITE 10/16/32 are not
supported. You will also need to make sure that this does not break ATA drives
managed with libata, so check libata-scsi translation.

Not saying this can all be accepted though. But that is what is needed.
