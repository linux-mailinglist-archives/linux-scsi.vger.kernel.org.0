We can't cover all typical workloads here, and I can write a application
easily to generate such sequential IO. Even though it is an unusual
workloads or application, someone still may report it as one regression,
so we can't risk to bypass .device_busy for HDD.

If the controller's max size is exposed to block layer, block will
make a proper size IO for controller. I believe all sane drivers do
that.

Anyway using per-LUN NONROT flag is flexible and reasonable, which
won't need driver's change.=20
