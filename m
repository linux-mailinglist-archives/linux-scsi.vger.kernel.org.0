Hi,

Basically I was going the same route as with this message:

  pr_debug_ratelimited("%s/%s: Unsupported SCSI Opcode 0x%02x, sending CHECK_CONDITION.\n"

IMO it's kinda the same situation. I'm not sure that not implemented VPD
will be of any interest to anyone except for the developers.

Also if I recall correctly pr_err_once() will be triggered once per code
line, not per message, so it's possible to actually lose the info if
more that one page is not implemented.
