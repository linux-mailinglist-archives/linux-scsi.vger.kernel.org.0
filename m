Maybe interest Matthew into doing the heavy lifting:

void xa_compact_and_sort(struct xa_array *xa,
                          int offset_ul_idx,
                          int (*compar)(const void *l, const void *r));

[Function modelled on qsort(3), perhaps qsort_r(3) would be better.]

The second argument to xa_compact_and_sort() is either:
     - offsetof(struct struct, sh_idx) where sh_idx is an unsigned long, or
     - if less than zero then ignore index fixup and don't compact

The third argument is either:
      - a compare function that, for example, acts on an ordering for the
        key: channel_id,target_id and uses it to return <0, ==0 or >=0
        based on being called with pointers to two starget objects, or
      - NULL: then just do a compaction if ul_idx >= 0

So when ul_idx >= 0 xa_compact_and_sort() places the new compacted index
at each *((unsigned long *)((u8 *)starget) + ul_idx)). So in the case of
my 1/6 patch the type of sh_idx would change from int to unsigned long.
