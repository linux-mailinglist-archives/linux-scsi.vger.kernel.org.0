James,
If you think it is bullet-proof try using CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE=y .
John Garry reported that:

  # insmod scsi_debug.ko

Gave errors like this:

[  140.115244] debugfs: Directory 'sde' with parent 'block' already present!
[  140.376426] debugfs: Directory 'sde' with parent 'block' already present!
[  140.420613] sd 3:0:0:0: [sde] tag#40 access beyond end of device
[  140.426655] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev sde, sector 15984 op 
0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 1 prio class 0
[  140.437319] sd 3:0:0:0: [sde] tag#41 access beyond end of device
[  140.443368] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev sde, sector 15984 op 
0x0:(READ) flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 0
...

Which wasn't the scsi_debug driver directly as it doesn't use debugfs. So
I suspect something is rotten in the mid-level.

When I tried to replicate John's config I couldn't even boot my Ubuntu
20.04 based system (with a MKP kernel). Seemed to fail/lockup before any
kernel prints came out to the serial port (yes, still useful), perhaps in
initrd. I'm guessing another, non-SCSI module caused the lockup. So I
gave up and turned off that config setting.
