I need to correct what I wrote above. I recall that years ago, when I 
needed to share storage from my Linux box to my PowerBook pismo, I used 
ethernet and the globalSAN iSCSI initiator for Mac OS X (which is no 
longer freely available AFAICS). When I said that I had used the SBP 
target driver before, I misremembered that iSCSI target setup. I've 
actually never used the SBP target driver.

It's a good question. I don't know the answer.

I have successfully used the Linux sbp2 host driver in the past, and will 
probably need to use it again. Likewise, I can see myself using the sbp 
target driver in the future because that might interoperate with MacOS 9, 
and might provide a bootable device to the PowerMac ROM. iSCSI cannot do 
those things.
