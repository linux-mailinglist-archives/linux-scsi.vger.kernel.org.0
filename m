Recovery happens when there is N * M inflight requests, then scsi_dec_host_busy()
can be called for each inflight request/scmnd from irq context.

host lock serializes every scsi_eh_wakeup().

Given each hardware queue has its own irq handler, so there could be one
request, scsi_dec_host_busy() is called and the host lock is spinned until
it is released from scsi_dec_host_busy() for all requests from all other
hardware queues.

The spin time can be long enough to trigger the hard lockup if N and M
is big enough, and the total wait time can be:

	(N - 1) * M * time_taken_in_scsi_host_busy().

Meantime the same story happens on scsi_eh_inc_host_failed() which is
called from softirq context, so host lock spin can be much more worse.

It is observed on mpi3mr with 128(N) hw queues and 8169(M) queue depth.

It is only possible when it is called in per-command situation.
