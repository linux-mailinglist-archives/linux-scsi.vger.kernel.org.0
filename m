It looks to me like there is an additional generic block device that
sits on top and that is what actually has the idle timeout.  Or maybe
that's the scsi disk, since it's name incldues the SCSI LUN, but in the
structure, its called sdev_gendev.  But then there's also sdev_dev, and
sdev_target.

I'm not sure about it.  The port has to be resumed so that we can
attempt to revalidate the devices on it.  For disks that have spun up on
their own, we should not leave then marked as runtime suspended, but
really they are spinning.  I suppose we could put them to sleep, though
I was leaning to just marking them as active, and leaving the runtime pm
timer to put them to sleep later, which then could allow the port to
suspend again.
