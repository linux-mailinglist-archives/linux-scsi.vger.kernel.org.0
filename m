Why? They're only called on reboot or shutdown.  In orderly cases, the
queues should have been stopped long ago, so there should be no I/O to
quiesce, and in the disorderly case, you obviously didn't care about
the data anyway, so the job of the shutdown routine is to salvage as
much as it can, which is why we flush the cache and stop the disk if
necessary.

If that's true, that would argue that the block layer caller should be
aware of the shutdown and not do this.  On the other hand, if the TUR
fails, what is the harm?

I don't think it does: in the orderly case, there should be no I/O
outstanding, so nothing to trigger and in the disorderly case, you have
no expectation of the I/O reaching the device, so what would the actual
bug be that this fixes?
