Hi Christoph,

I sent out v7 of the patch series. It's at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20200221115050.238976-1-satyat@google.com/T/#t

It manages keyslots on a per-request basis now - I made it get keyslots
in blk_mq_get_request, because that way I wouldn't have to worry about
programming keys in an atomic context. What do you think of the new
approach?
