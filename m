ATTN: BENEFICIARY:

I REV.SCHEDRAC T JOHNSON, DIRECTOR CASH PROCESSING UNIT, UNITED BANK
FOR AFRICA [UBA] THE ONLY BANK APPOINTED BY O.A.U MEMBERS LED BY
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ON HIS LAST VISIT TO AFRICA AND SEVEN COUNTRIES
GOVERNMENT WITH  WORLD HIGH COMMISSION AGAINST FRAUD ACTIVITIES BY THE
SEVEN COUNTRY CITIZENS.

BECAUSE OF THE FRAUD GOING ON IN WEST AFRICA COUNTRIES WHERE SOME
INNOCENT BENEFICIARIES WERE ASK TO PAY IN ADVANCE BEFORE  RECEIVE THE
MONEY OWNED TO THEM. THE ABOVE AFRICA UNION HELD MEETING IN BENIN
REPUBLIC AND RESOLVE TO PAY ALL BENEFICIARIES IN CASH THROUGH MEANS
DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICE.WE RECEIVE YOUR FILES FROM INTERNATIONAL
MONETARY FUND (I.M.F) AS ONE OF THE BENEFICIARIES.

TAKE NOTE; TEN THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS  (US$10,000) HAVE BEEN
MAPPED OUT FOR ALL EXPENSES IN SENDING THE MONEY TO YOU THROUGH
GENUINE DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICE AND HOW IT WAS SPENT WILL BE
DETAILS TO YOU.THEREFORE, I WANT YOU TO BEAR IT IN MIND THAT YOUR
TOTAL FUND WILL BE NO MORE FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED
STATE DOLLARS ($4,500,000.00) BUT FOUR MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY
THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS ($4,490,000.00).

IF ANY BODY TELLS YOU THAT HE WILL PAY YOU IN BANK DRAFT, TELE-GRAFIC
WIRE TRANSFER OR WESTERN UNION/MONEY GRAM, DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM OR HER
BECAUSE DUE TO THIS FRAUD NO INTERNATIONAL BANK HONORS OUR REMITTANCE
INSTRUCTION ANY MORE. THAT IS WHY WE SETTLED TO PAY IN CASH THROUGH
DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICE.

WE ALSO RECEIVED A SECURITY REPORT THAT YOU PAID THOSE FRAUDSTERS WHO
HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU, TELLING YOU THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SEND THIS
MONEY TO YOU.DEAR, AS A SENIOR BANKER, CONTROLLING THIS CASH PAYMENT
NOW, I ADVISE YOU NOT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY BY PAYING ANY BODY IN
ADVANCE AGAIN, AND IF YOU JUST FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTION, YOU WILL RECEIVE
YOUR MONEY IN THREE DAYS TIME.

YOUR FUND WILL NOW PACKAGE IN BOX AND TAKE TO THE DIPLOMATIC COURIER
SERVICE FOR IMMEDIATE SHIPMENT, BUT THE KEY TO THE BOX WILL SEND TO
YOU SEPARATELY BY (DHL COURIER COMPANY) TO AVOID THE COURIER SERVICE
STAFF INTERCEPT WITH THE CONTENT. I WILL ALSO SEND THE PICTURE OF THE
BOX BY ATTACHMENT TO YOU TO SEE HOW THE MONEY IS PACKED

THEREFORE, DO FORWARD YOUR HOME ADDRESS AND DIRECT PHONE
NUMBER,OCCUPATION TO ME FOR QUICK DELIVERY BECAUSE TIME IS NOT IN OUR
SIDE. ALL THE DOCUMENTS WILL BE SENT TO YOU IF I AM ASSURE THAT YOU
HAVE STOOPED SENDING MONEY TO THOSE FRAUDSTER. BUT GOD WILL SURELY
JUDGE ALL OF THEM WHO LIVES BY CHEATING. MY BIBLE SAYS WHAT DOES IT
PROFIT A MAN TO GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD BUT LOOSE YOUR SOUL.

AM WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU WITH THE REQUIRED INFORMATION OF YOURS.
