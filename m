Eric,

I also don't understand why you need such a setup. Can you explain more 
details of your topology?

The removed code is only for races before we serialize the event 
processing. All PHYs will still be scanned one by one and add to the 
wide port if they have the same address. So are you encountering a real 
issue? If so, can you share the full log?

Thanks,
Jason
