No, sounds the same as your case. As an example think of vdfuse (or
qemu-nbd locally). You'd have something like

ext4(a) <- loop <- fuse file system <- vdfuse <- disk.vdi container file
<- ext4(b) <- block device

If vdfuse threads cause writeback to ext4(a), you'd get the issue we
have. Setting PF_LESS_THROTTLE and/or PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO mostly avoids
this problem, but with only PF_LESS_THROTTLE there are still corner
cases (I think if ext4(b) slows down suddenly) where it wedges itself
and the side effect of setting PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO are being discussed...
The best solution would be, I guess, to have a way for vdfuse to set
something, such that write-back to ext4(a) isn't allowed from those
threads, but write-back to ext4(b) (and all other block devices) is. But
I only have a rough idea of how write-back works, so this is really only
a guess.
