We may be protected by the async_synchronize_full waiting for probably
the  do_scan_async to end and that protects us from use after free - all
that seems to resolve after a longer time and the driver is removed in
the end.
Maybe the driver could react better to when its exit function is called
but what is wrong with keeping an additional module reference during the
scan process, the driver's exit function can't then be called from
module removal code at any time and there is no weird behavior?
