And we shouldn't forget that the main issue which killed all previous 
implementations was a missing QoS guarantee.
It's nice to have simply copy, but if the implementation is _slower_ 
than doing it by hand from the OS there is very little point in even 
attempting to do so.
I can't see any provisions for that in the TPAR, leading me to the 
assumption that NVMe simple copy will suffer from the same issue.

So if we can't address this I guess this attempt will fail, too.

Cheers,

Hannes
