Hello,

May I ask how you approach funding of projects/deals?

For over the years, We've provided secured and unsecured loans to individuals/Companies with viable projects who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining financing via conventional channels. If your business is organized and needs capital, we can provide a business or personal loan for your projects.

We do accept broker business and will offer a reasonable percentage of comission. I'd love to discuss your current goals and see if we can help you get your desired funding needs. Visit our website for more details.

Thanks,
Richard Poddos.
