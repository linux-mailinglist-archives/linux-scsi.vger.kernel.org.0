Right. And removing code isn't free either, if it forces people to find 
workarounds.

And yet some people seem to enjoy writing patches that are as trivial as 
they are invasive...

You seem to be making an argument for more automation here, not an 
argument for less code. Or is there some upper bound to the size of the 
kernel, that might be lifted by adding maintainers? (Can you deliver a 
better product by adding more developers to your project?)

But if maintenance cost rises due to good analysis, the value of the code 
should rise too. So what's the problem? It seems to me that the real 
problem is too many analyses that generate pedantic noise and no tangible 
improvement in code quality or value.

When stable, mature code fails analysis, the analysis is also questionable 
(in the absence of real examples).

You seem to be saying that 1) a driver should be removed when it no longer 
meets the present threshold for code quality and 2) that a low quality 
driver is eligible for re-addition because someone wants to use it.
I don't think you can have it both ways.

Yes it's your problem but only on a best-effort basis.

Many issues detected by automatic analyzers can be fixed with automatic 
code transformation tools. This kind of solution works tree-wide, so even 
if some defect in your driver is "yours and yours alone", the solution 
will probably come from others.

This email, like yours, is just hand-waving. So feel free to ignore it or 
(preferably) provide evidence of real defects.
