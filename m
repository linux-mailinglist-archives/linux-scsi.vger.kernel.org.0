Sorry, you are regressing something that has been in place for over
20 years and required by SPC (1 through 5) standards. The onus
should not be on me to prove that regression is not safe. It should
be the other way around (i.e. for you to prove that it is safe).

I admit that working with scsi_debug can be fun, but it seems to me a
few other people have found it a useful tool. Some football advice
might apply here: play the ball, not the man.

 From my laptop (64 bit) where scsi_cmnd1 is the original struct scsi_cmnd:
     xtwo70 kernel: sizeof(struct scsi_cmnd)=376, sizeof(struct scsi_cmnd1)=392

So is slightly > 4% (higher on 32 bit machines) insignificant?

Since I have that measurement code in place, try a few other things ....
Changing scsi_cmnd::flags to be a u8 and putting sense_buffer and host_scribble
next to one another (they are pointers) gives:
     xtwo70 kernel: sizeof(struct scsi_cmnd)=360, sizeof(struct scsi_cmnd1)=392

Now we are at a 8% reduction.

In commit ce70fd9a551af7424a7dace2a1ba05a7de8eae27 you wrote:

    "Now that each scsi_request is backed by a scsi_cmnd, there is no need to
     indirect the CDB storage.  Change all submitters of SCSI passthrough
     requests to store the CDB information directly in the scsi_cmnd, and while
     doing so allocate the full 32 bytes that cover all Linux supported SCSI
     hosts instead of requiring dynamic allocation for > 16 byte CDBs.  On
     64-bit systems this does not change the size of the scsi_cmnd at all, while
     on 32-bit systems it slightly increases it for now, but that increase will
     be made up by the removal of the remaining scsi_request fields."

  $ cd drivers/scsi
  $ find . -name '*.c' -exec grep "SCSI_MAX_VARLEN_CDB_SIZE" {} \; -print
	shost->max_cmd_len = SCSI_MAX_VARLEN_CDB_SIZE;
./iscsi_tcp.c
		shost->max_cmd_len = SCSI_MAX_VARLEN_CDB_SIZE;
./cxgbi/libcxgbi.c

include/scsi/scsi_proto.h:#define SCSI_MAX_VARLEN_CDB_SIZE 260

Two examples that make your "the full 32 bytes that cover all ..." assertion
false.

Also those quoted comments seem to give weight to the argument that
writer believes that the size of scsi_cmnd matters. If so, I agree,
smaller is better.

Seriously?

As well, having a scsi_cmnd destructor opens up the possibility of deferring
kmem_cache_free(scsi_sense_cache, cmd->sense_buffer) from scsi_mq_exit_request()
to that destructor. Then if scsi_cmnd objects are re-used,
scsi_mq_init_request() need only get a cmd->sense_buffer if one has not yet
been allocated. Again, I present no data, but pretty obviously a performance
win.


Another advantage of that patchset:
    - in scsi_initialize_rq() the patch initializes CBD to Test Unit Ready
      (6 zeros), previously it did a memset(scmd->cmnd, 0, 32), so that is
      another small win.
      That initialization could be further optimized with:
          scmd->l_cdb.dummy_tur = 0;    /* clears first 8 zeros */
          scmd->cmd_len = SCSI_TEST_UNIT_READY_CDB_LEN;
      to bypass memset() completely.

As Bart pointed out, the dynamic allocation for 32-byte CDBs is relatively
rare, more than made up for by the 4% reduction in struct scsi_cmnd's size.

As for the second sentence, if this patchset is accepted, I will find
and fix those. The ones I did check limited cdb_s to 16 bytes.
