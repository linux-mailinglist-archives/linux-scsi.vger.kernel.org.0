I just run fio benchmark tool with --rw=randread, --bs=4kb, --
size=8G/10G/64G/100G. and see what performance diff with the direct
submission approach.

Taking into consideration of the HPB 2.0, can we submit the HPB write
request to the SCSI layer? if not, it will be a direct submission way.
why not directly use direct way? or maybe you have a more advisable
approach to work around this. would you please share with us.
appreciate.

I saw that, so I should add a timer in order to optimise HPB reqeust
scheduling/completition. this is ok so far.
