This problem has existed since it was decided to do loading of things at in=
it.
Its a terribly bad idea t do a lot work at init.

Nope. That's not it. I tried by disabling async scan and also forcing it as=
 I
mentioned by exporting the function to wait.

I'm afraid scsi_debug is filled with bug bombs bound to happen, because it =
was
written without certain consideration of races now coming up as tangible wi=
th
syfs / driver load. Namely, if you hold a lock at init and also use it on s=
ysfs
attributes you can easily deadlock. I discovered this issue first with the =
zram
driver, and fixed the issue with try_module_get()'s on each driver sysfs
attribute, I posted patches for that, for discussion on that see the post [=
0]
[1], although discussion is mostly on the first patch, the patch you want to
look at is the second one [1].

[1] https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210306022035.11266-3-mcgrof@kernel.org

I considered fixing scsi_debug in light of this, but given that module
initialization is *also* calling helpers used by syfs attributes, *and* thi=
s is
also true at module removal, I'm afraid much more care is needed here. In my
patch to zram for the sysfs issue I mention ways to trigger the deadlock, if
you're up for the task to fix that, it would be wonderful. But hey, these a=
re
separate issues. just figured you should be aware.

rmmod does just that when it can find that. In this case it can just provid=
e a
refcount.

OK cool, we could try this, but I'm afraid it would not fix the issue, given
that you may have userspace applications such as multipath mucking with the
device on init, and you won't know when its done. So I still think that the
onus is on userspace here.

Ideally I'd actually just remove the damn setup stuff on init, but since we
have old users, I'm afraid that's not possible now. Granted, scsi_debug is a
developer tool, so perhaps its OK to deprecate that. But still, you end up =
with
the same requirements to verify the refcnt is 1 before trying to remove it.

ult.

Why not?

fstests / blktests relies on scsi_debug for a few tests, we need a solution
documented / in palce for both upstream / older kernels. If setting the
not-ready thing on init works, we would still need to verify a solution for
older kernels.
