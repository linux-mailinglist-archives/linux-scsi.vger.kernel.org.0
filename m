I think I have some servers that have the same chipset. But being servers,
suspend/resume is not well supported. Can try suspend to disk at least, but=
 not
suspend to RAM.

You could try with the revert of 6aa0365a3c85. What I think you are seeing =
is
the X client start (Wayland ?) being delayed by the fact that with
6aa0365a3c85, resume waits for the HDD to be revalidated. Hence the delay f=
or X
& mouse to start working.

See above. It could be. But permanently reverting 6aa0365a3c85 is not a
solution as that commit fixes a real problem that some users reported and t=
hat
you could also hit yourself by reverting it. As I said, if you confirm that
this commit is indeed the cause of the delay, I can try to see how to reduce
the delay, if possible. The main issue is that the resume code is a bit of a
mess between libata and scsi, and libata resume is mostly done using EH (er=
ror
handler) context, which when running prevents using the drive for anything.=
 A
rework of the resume path may be needed but that is extremely dangerous as =
that
could introduce lots of regressions (because libata is in a sense the
accumulation of decades of "magic" code to deal with buggy adapters and dri=
ves,
and there are a lot out these out there). So extreme caution is needed when
touching such code.

I am the libata maintainer, and if you check my email address, you will see
that it is not hard for me to get SATA HDDs and SSDs. I have 3 racks of mac=
hine
in my lab with literally hundreds of HDDs and SSDs usable, and also some PCs
with CD/DVD, old parallel ATA drives, port multiplier enclosures, etc. Many
favors of hardware.

But that does not mean that I can reproduce all issues notified by users. I
could never reproduce the issue that commit 6aa0365a3c85 fixes so my tests =
only
confirmed that I was not seeing any regression (and I did not see a bad del=
ay
with anything as I do not run any GUI on my machines).

Rather than hardware, which I have plenty, I would be happier with people
spending time testing for-next and RC trees to verify that patches do not h=
ave
unintended side effects. libata is not the sexiest of subsystems and it is =
hard
to get people to review and test patches.
