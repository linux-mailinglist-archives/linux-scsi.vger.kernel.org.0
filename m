My issue is not with passthough report zones.

The report zones command is failing on driver load and causing the drive 
to fail to appear as a block device. If queue_max_segments is set to a 
value over 1024, then nr_vecs in bio_alloc() will be greater than 
UIO_MAXIOV and bio_alloc() will return NULL.

This causes the error.
```
sd 8:0:0:0: [sdb] REPORT ZONES start lba 0 failed
sd 8:0:0:0: [sdb] REPORT ZONES: Result: hostbyte=0xff driverbyte=DRIVER_OK
sdb: failed to revalidate zones
```

You can reproduce this by setting the max_sgl_entries parameter to 2k or 
greater in the mpt3sas driver. Other drivers can also reproduce this 
behavior.
