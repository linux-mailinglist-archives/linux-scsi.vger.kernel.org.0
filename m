Just wondering why smartpqi SAS won't set one proper .cmd_per_lun for
avoiding the issue, looks the driver simply assigns .can_queue to it,
then it isn't strange to see the timeout issue. If .can_queue is a bit
big, HDD. is easily saturated too long.

mq-deadline basically won't merge IO if STS_RESOURCE isn't returned from
.queue_rq(), or blk_mq_get_dispatch_budget always return true. NVMe's
.queue_rq() basically always returns STS_OK.
