The long-term wrapped key has to be wiped from memory as soon as it's no longer
needed.  So it's hard to see how overloading a key type in this way can work, as
the kernel can't know if userspace intends to read back the long-term wrapped
key or not.

Those features aren't compatible with hardware-wrapped inline encryption keys,
so they're not really relevant here.  BLKCRYPTOIMPORTKEY could support importing
a keyring service key as an alternative to a raw key, of course.  But this would
just work similarly to fscrypt and dm-crypt where they just extract the payload,
and the keyring service key plays no further role.

That's not going to work.  Upper layers need to know what the crypto
capabilities are before they decide to use them.  We can't randomly revoke
capabilities based on who happened to get there first, as a user might have
already checked the capabilities.  Yes, the module parameter is a litle
annoying, but it seems to be necessary here.  It is not a problem for Android
because the type of encryption an Android device uses is set by the build
anyway, which makes it no easier to change than module parameters.
