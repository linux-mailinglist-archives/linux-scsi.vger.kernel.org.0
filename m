I think that one should go last. Or, to be more specific, switching the 
drivers to expose multiple queues - which is part of that series - 
should go last.

Until we expose multiple queues, we still have a single HW queue from 
blk-mq perspective, so will only have a single tagset per HBA, so no 
chance of duplicate tags.

This series should be able to go in without dependencies.

Thanks,
