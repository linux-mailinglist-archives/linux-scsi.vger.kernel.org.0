Oh yeah, just to make sure I am on the same page for vdpa, because scsi 
and net work so differnetly.

Were you thinking that you would initially run from

vhost_poll_wakeup -> work->fn

then in the vdpa work->fn you would do the kick_vq still, but then also 
kick off a group backend/vq poller. This would then poll the vqs/devs 
that were bound to that CPU from the worker/wq thread.

So I was thinking you want something similar to network's NAPI. Here our 
work->fn is the hard irq, and then the worker is like their softirq we 
poll from.
