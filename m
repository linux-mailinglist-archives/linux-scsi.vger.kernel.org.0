Sorry, I had overlooked this request. I reviewed this thread now, because I want to switch our production systems to 5.10 LTS.

I could reproduce the problem with Linux 5.10.22. When setting `host_tagset = 1`, the problem disappeared. Additionally, we have 5.10.22 with the patch running on two previously affected production systems for over 24 hours now. Statistics suggest, that these systems were very likely to trigger the problem in that time frame if the patch didn't work.
    
So I think this is a working fix which should go to 5.10 stable.

Best
   Donald
