Short answer: in the current scsi_debug driver all responses arrive in
submission order. So there is a large class of errors that it won't find.


Longer answer:
Core dumps and log messages often occur well after the misstep in the code
that caused them.

In my case, I was looking for a bug in the sg driver associated with
request sharing for a disk to disk copy (reference:
http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg_v40.html Figure 6). I ran the sg app (sgh_dd)
for several weeks tweaking this and that without any sign of failure.
However if I ran it using real SSDs then the error would occur but at
such a low frequency (say once per day) it was difficult to isolate.
I suspected the error occurred when at least one response arrived out
of submission order. Hence the patch presented here. In a relatively
short period of time (say between several seconds and several minutes)
the error occurred with 'ndelay=20000 random=1". This allowed me to
work back and find the faulty state transition.

So I assumed this technique might be more generally useful for those who
test with scsi_debug.

I'll look into it.

The driver follows kernel conventions and does time keeping in either
milliseconds or nanoseconds. A minor disadvantage of nanosecond timekeeping
and 32 bit integers (e.g. as used by the sg driver for duration) is that
the largest duration it can represent is around 4.2 seconds. If one is
simulating READs and WRITEs on a SSD then 4 seconds is more than enough
but not for FORMAT UNIT. Hence the code above. This problem doesn't
completely disappear with microsecond resolution as its 32 bit maximum
(~ 4200 seconds) may still be too low for simulating FORMAT UNIT.

While I agree that microsecond precision is sufficient for logs ***
I find it useful to look at nanosecond precision when debugging the sg
and scsi_debug drivers. Arnd Bergmann warned me that there is a (slight)
time penalty when reading the high precision counters on some
architectures. That is why there are "_coarse_" variants in some of
the timekeeping headers.

checkpatch.pl seems inconsistent when strings violate the Fortran punch card
line length limit. Sometimes checkpatch complains and sometimes it follows
the kernel coding standards and doesn't complain. It complained about my
original effort, so I abridged it.
Yes, your suggestion is clearer (and longer).

No.
Why didn't you complain when MKP wrote that? That is where I cut and
pasted that code from (sdebug_removable).

Yes. And it complained, but not about that :-)
Again, copy and paste from MKP's code (which no doubt was a copy + paste from
my earlier code).

Ask MKP, it's his code. All I do know is that doing a printk("%p" ...) is
useless in lk 5.3 (and probably lk 5.2). Taking the above snippet, if
vmalloc() returned NULL then the existing pr_err() would print out
a random number rather than <null>. Sick ...
