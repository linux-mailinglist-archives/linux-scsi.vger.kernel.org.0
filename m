Thank you for continuing to work on this!

According to your cover letter, this feature requires a custom TrustZone image
to work on SM8550.  Will that image be made available outside Qualcomm?

Also according to your cover letter, this feature will work on SM8650 out of the
box.  That's great to hear.  However, SM8650 does not appear to be publicly
available yet or have any upstream kernel support.  Do you know approximately
when a SM8650 development board will become available to the general public?

Also, can you please make available a git branch somewhere that contains your
patchset?  It sounds like this depends on
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/fscrypt/linux.git/log/?h=wrapped-keys-v7, but
actually a version of it that you've rebased, which I don't have access to.
Without being able to apply your patchset, I can't properly review it.

Thanks!

- Eric
