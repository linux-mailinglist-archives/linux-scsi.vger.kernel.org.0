MQ & deep queue depth will cause trouble for HDD., as Damien mentioned,=20
IO timeout may be caused. Then looks you need to add per-ns queue depth,
just like what sdev->device_busy does for avoiding IO timeout. On the
other hand, with per-ns queue depth, you may prevent IO submitted to NVMe
when this ns is saturated, then block layer's IO merge can be triggered.

If NVMe doesn't sort/merge across SQs, it should be better to just use
single queue for HDD. Otherwise, it is easy to break IO order & merge.

Even someone complains that sequential IO becomes dis-continuous on
NVMe(SSD) when arbitration burst is less than IO queue depth. It is said
fio performance is hurt, but I don't understand how that can happen on
SSD.
