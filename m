As your said, it is better to do extra validation in userspace (multipathd).
However, in some cases, the userspace cannot see the real-time present devices
info as Martin (committer of multipath-tools) said.
In addition, the kernel can see right device info in the table at any time,
so the uuid check in kernel can ensure one multipath is composed with paths mapped to
the same device.

Considering the severity of the wrong path in multipath, I think it worths more
checking.
