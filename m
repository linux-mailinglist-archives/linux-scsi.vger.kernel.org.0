Are you guys talking about different issues?

tcm loop does not take a reference to the scsi_device at creation/link
time then need to release at removal/unlink time. The above
scsi_device_put is for the successful scsi_device_lookup call. tcm loop
works like a scsi host driver that does its own scanning via
scsi_add_device (maybe similar to scsi drivers that are raid cards).
Like other host drivers it does not take a reference to the device when
it is added and relies on scsi-ml to handle all that for it before doing
operations like queuecommand.

The leak is if you removed the scsi_device via the scsi ml sysfs
interface then there is no way to completely unlink the lio port because
if scsi_device_lookup fails we return from the function and do not do
not release our refcount on the tl_tpg_port_count.
