Three reasons that I don't:
   1) making the first argument of type size_t may constrict the size
      that can be allocated on a 32 bit machine (faint recollection of
      extended/expanded memory on 8086). uint64_t would be better
      than unsigned long long but see point 3)
   2) making the last (fifth) argument of type size_t is overkill on a
      64 bit machine. IMO 32 bits is sufficient. The maximum unsigned int
      is 2^32 - 1 and with a typical PAGE_SIZE of 4096 bytes and order 0,
      that is roughly 2^44 bytes or about 16 TB. If part of the kernel
      did want 16 TB in a single allocation, I hope it would choose a
      larger value for order. So then the maximum single allocation
      would be 2^(44+MAX_ORDER-1) bytes. Can I stop now?
   3) it changes the signature of an existing exported kernel function
      requiring changes in several call sites. Changing an output pointer
      type may require more than a one line change at the existing call
      sites. Due to the fact that this patch is removing an existing
      4 GB limit, those call sites have zero need for this. If I was
      maintaining the driver containing those call sites, I would be
      a bit peeved. [That said, maintaining out-of-tree patchsets, while
      trying to get them accepted in the mainline, is a considerable
      pain due to the constant changes in the block layer API.]
