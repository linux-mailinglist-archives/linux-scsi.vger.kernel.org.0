Make a variety of corrections to ufs.rst:

- add spaces around parenthetical phrases
- correct singular/plural grammar and nouns
- correct punctuation
- add article adjectives
- add hyphens to multi-word adjectives
- spell Lun as LUN
- spell upiu as UPIU (in text, not code examples)
- don't capitalize generic "specification"
