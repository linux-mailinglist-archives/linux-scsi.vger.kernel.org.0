What is the queue depth for this claim ?

FYI, I am about to post 20-something patches that completely remove zone write
locking and replace it with "zone write plugging". That is done above the IO
scheduler and also provides zone append emulation for drives that ask for it.

With this change:
 - Zone append emulation is moved to the block layer, as a generic
implementation. sd and dm zone append emulation code is removed.
 - Any scheduler can be used, including "none". mq-deadline zone block device
special support is removed.
 - Overall, a lot less code (the series removes more code than it adds).
 - Reordering problems such as due to IO priority is resolved as well.

This will need a lot of testing, which we are working on. But your help with
testing on UFS devices will be appreciated as well.
