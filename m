It's because the sdev is passed to the work queue to execute the RTPG.
To my understanding, the rationale is that the caller's ref may be
given up before the workqueue starts running, thus an additional ref is
needed to make sure the sdev isn't freed before the workqueue accesses
it. But if queue_delayed_work() fails (e.g. because the item is already
queued) this additional ref must be given up.
