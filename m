I see, Thanks for point out, after commit ee37e09d81a4 ("[SCSI] fix
duplicate removal on error path in scsi_sysfs_add_sdev"), Before this
errno will be forced to return 0.

After:

[1] error = device_create_file(&sdev->sdev_gendev,  	
                            sdev->host->hostt->sdev_attrs[i]);

Then:

with 92c4b58b15c5 ("scsi: core: Register sysfs attributes earlier")
delete code [1], so we force return errno.

I don’t know if I should restore the original logic or delete
this comment information. Guenter and Christoph, What do you think? I
can send another patch based on this.
