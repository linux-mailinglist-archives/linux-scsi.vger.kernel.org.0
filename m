I had the idea to change the check in scsi_sysfs.c from:
-       return (sdp->inq_periph_qual =3D=3D SCSI_INQ_PQ_CON)? 1: 0;
+       return (sdp->inq_periph_qual !=3D SCSI_INQ_PQ_NOT_CAP)? 1: 0;

This would allow PQ=3D1 but not PQ=3D3 which I think is the right thing =
to do.

Yes we can support read capacity when in the unavailable state. For
us the unavailable state means that one controller or array can not
reach the other controller or array on the backend but the front end
ports are still connected. They are up from an initiator transport
perspective.

Unfortunately this doesn=E2=80=99t work. This does work in other OS=E2=80=99=
s where
I can logout the connection, and when it comes back it will discover
that the LUN no longer has the PQ set and will come online fine. But
in Linux this results in (after the PLOGI and PRLI):

Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY pass 1 =
length 36
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY =
successful with code 0x0
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY pass 2 =
length 96
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY =
successful with code 0x0
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: peripheral =
device type of 31, no device added
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: Sending REPORT =
LUNS to (try 0)
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: REPORT LUNS =
successful (try 0) result 0x0
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:0: scsi scan: REPORT LUN =
scan
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:1: scsi scan: device exists =
on 7:0:0:1
Jan 25 11:42:28 init72-5 kernel: scsi 7:0:0:2: scsi scan: device exists =
on 7:0:0:2

So unless those devices are removed before the rescan, which I
cannot control from the target, an sd device will not be created on=20
the rescanning after the logout.
