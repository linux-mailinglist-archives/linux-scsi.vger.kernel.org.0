Hello,

How are you once again. I have been having difficulty reaching you. I 
have an important business transaction to discuss with you.  There are 
funds available and ready for investment which we will need your 
assistance to invest. Do get back to me as soon as you can for more 
details.

Regards,

Andrew A. Page
