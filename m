Kashyap,
Good catch!

You could roll all the scsi_debug stuff into one patch and put both
our sign-offs on it, or present it as two patches:
   - first one: your original plus this fix
   - second one: mine with your tested-by on it

Since this is new functionality for the scsi sub-system, it is unlikely
that all the corner cases have been visited. However, with what we have
in place for the next cycle, others have something reasonably solid to
build on.
