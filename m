Hi Bart,

Please let me address your concern.

First of all, it is allowed to call scsi_device_quiesce() multiple 
times,
but one sdev's request queue's pm_only counter can only be increased 
once
by scsi_device_quiesce(), because if a sdev has already been quiesced,
in scsi_device_quiesce(), scsi_device_set_state(sdev, SDEV_QUIESCE) 
would
return -ENIVAL (illegal state transform), then blk_clear_pm_only() shall
be called to decrease pm_only once, so no matter how many times
scsi_device_quiesce() is called, it can only increase pm_only once.

scsi_device_resume() is same, it calls blk_clear_pm_only only once and
only if the sdev was quiesced().

So, in a word, after scsi_device_resume() returns in 
scsi_dev_type_resume(),
pm_only counter should be 1 (if the sdev's runtime power status is
RPM_SUSPENDED) or 0 (if the sdev's runtime power status is RPM_ACTIVE).

Yes, I used to make the patch like that way, and it also worked well, as
both ways are equal actually. I kinda like the current code because we
should be confident that after scsi_dev_type_resume() returns, pm_only
must be 0. Different reviewers may have different opionions, either way
works well anyways.

Thanks,

Can Guo.
