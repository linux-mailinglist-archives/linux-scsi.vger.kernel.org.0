Yes most of the noise is due to the ql_dbg() statemenents. I supppose the
simplest way would to undefine it so no code is generated.

I am not sure what triggers the compiler to have different numberings. Mabye a
newer gcc would behave better, no idea. I used the on shipped on SLE15-SP1,
which means a bit older :)

Maybe, I don't know if they tools from this project help for such an analysis.

Well, I ended up going through the filtered diff. Obviously, with such a big
diff it's easy to miss something but I don't think it's a problem. The patch
got reviewes and the tools do also help to find bugs.

Thanks,
Daniel
