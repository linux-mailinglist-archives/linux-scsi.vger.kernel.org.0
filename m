As I said, it may be because the block layer disk revalidate call and partition
scan are reversed, or not synchronized, causing the partition scan read to be
dealt with without the sector size yet being updated in the sd driver. We should
check the block layer. Will have a look.

Sure, I know that. But the kernel never asks for unaligned read/writes and the
disk will certainly never return a half backed sector for reads or partially
writes sectors. So getting back a resid that is not aligned on the LBA size is a
gross bug from the HBA and we should not allow that to go unnoticed.
