Which fd will be used for this IOCTL? One of the 'vhostfd' or we should 
create a new /dev/vhost-workers (or something similar)?

Maybe the new device will be cleaner and can be reused also for other 
stuff (I'm thinking about vDPA software devices).

Maybe in this case we should do something similar to io_uring SQPOLL 
kthread where kthread_use_mm()/kthread_unuse_mm() is used to switch 
virtual memory spaces.

After writing, I saw that we already do it this in the vhost_worker() in 
drivers/vhost/vhost.c

I think ioctl(VHOST_WORKER_RUN) might be the right way and also maybe 
the least difficult one.
