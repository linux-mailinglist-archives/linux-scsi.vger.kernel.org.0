I find that the device state is SDEV_RUNNING for me at that point (so it 
cannot work).

Could we somehow signal from __scsi_remove_device() earlier that the 
request queue is dying or at least in some error state, so that 
blk_queue_enter() in the rescan can fail?

Currently we don't call blk_cleanup_queue() -> blk_set_queue_dying() 
until after the device_del(sdev_gendev) call in __scsi_remove_device().

Thanks,
John
