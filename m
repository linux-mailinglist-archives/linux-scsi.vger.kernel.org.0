On the same vein: why didn't we hook up 'wp reset' to trim/unmap?
The code says:

         if (sd_is_zoned(sdkp)) {
                 sd_config_discard(sdkp, SD_LBP_DISABLE);
                 return count;
         }

I distinctly remember to enable discards via 'wp reset' in the
original code; what happened to it?

Cheers,

Hannes
