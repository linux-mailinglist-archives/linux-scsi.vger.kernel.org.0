Sorry for the slow reply.  I was going to do some more investigation but
never found time.

I was wondering if it would be simpler to do the error recovery for
wl_system_suspend/resume() before exiting wl_system_suspend/resume().

Then it would be possible to do something along the lines:
	- prevent runtime suspend while the error handler is outstanding
	- at suspend, block queuing of the error handler work and flush it
	- at resume, allow queuing of the error handler work
