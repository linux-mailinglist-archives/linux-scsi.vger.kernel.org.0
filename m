Subject: [PATCH] scsi: aic7xxx: indent kconfig help text
Date: Mon,  8 Apr 2024 10:31:10 +0530

From: Prasad Pandit <pjp@fedoraproject.org>

Fix indentation of config option's help text by adding
leading spaces. Generally help text is indented by two
more spaces beyond the leading tab <\t> character.
It helps Kconfig parsers to read file without error.
