That's a complicated story.

In short, many drivers need to do this, but not all.  There is a complex 
collection of settings available for subsystems or drivers that would 
like their devices to remain in runtime system across a system sleep.

For the subsystems/drivers that don't care to deal with this complexity 
or don't have any special requirements -- yes, they all need to include 
code like this in their system-resume paths.

I had a very long discussion with Rafael Wysocki about all this starting 
last March; you can find the relevant emails beginning roughly here:

	https://marc.info/?l=linux-pm&m=158516934924947&w=2

and continuing through a few different threads.

Rafael ended up making a large number of changes to the PM core and API 
to simplify things, straighten them out, and improve the documentation.  
But we never did try to add this automatic set-runtime-active thing into 
the core.  Probably we wanted all the other changes to settle down 
before trying to do it, and then just forgot about it.  In fact, I'm not 
certain that it is possible now, but we should look into it.
