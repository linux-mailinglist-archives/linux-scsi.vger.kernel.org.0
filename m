When irqs_disabled() returns true, we cannot infer that=20
arch_local_irq_disable() was called. But I have not yet found driver code=
=20
or core kernel code attempting that inference.

>=20

Can you support that claim with a reference to core kernel code or=20
documentation? (If some arch code agrees with you, that's neither here nor=
=20
there.)

A glance at the ARM GIC specification suggests that your hardware works=20
much like 68000 hardware.

   When enabled, a CPU interface takes the highest priority pending=20
   interrupt for its connected processor and determines whether the=20
   interrupt has sufficient priority for it to signal the interrupt=20
   request to the processor. [...]

   When the processor acknowledges the interrupt at the CPU interface, the=
=20
   Distributor changes the status of the interrupt from pending to either=
=20
   active, or active and pending. At this point the CPU interface can=20
   signal another interrupt to the processor, to preempt interrupts that=20
   are active on the processor. If there is no pending interrupt with=20
   sufficient priority for signaling to the processor, the interface=20
   deasserts the interrupt request signal to the processor.

Have you considered that Linux/arm might benefit if it could fully exploit=
=20
hardware features already available, such as the interrupt priority=20
masking feature in the GIC in existing arm systems?

Like you, I was surprised when I learned about it. But that doesn't mean=20
it's wrong. The fact that it works should tell you something.

Things could always be made simpler. But discarding features isn't=20
necessarily an improvement.
