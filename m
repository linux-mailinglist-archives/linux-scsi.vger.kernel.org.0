It turned out that the application that we (Linaro) need does have the
same requirements and needs to store the key in a TEE, transferring
the message with the MAC into the kernel, rather than keeping the
key stored in user space or kernel.

However, after I had a look at the nvme-rpmb user space implementation,
I found that this is different, and always expects the key to be stored
in a local file:
https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli/blob/master/nvme-rpmb.c#L878

This both works with the same kernel interface though, as the kernel
would still get the data along with the HMAC, rather than having the key
stored in the kernel, but it does mean that the frame gets passed to
the kernel in a device specific layout, with at least nvme using an incompatible
layout from everything else.
