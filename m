Right, but the first one should be returning actual status from the
drive, so should be OK.  The second one looks to be returning
manufactured raid status, which is likely the problem.

in either case, just fix the code to return DID_ERROR<<16 if the status
is non SAM conforming.

I don't believe it does: that commit should produce identical code
before and after; it merely replaced the shifted status conditions with
the unshifted ones.

So as I said previously, get the driver to return DID_ERROR<<16 for the
bogus SAM conditions.
