Subject: [PATCH 20/22] lpfc: Correct function header comments related to ndlp reference counting
Date:   Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:44:41 -0800
Message-Id: <20210211234443.3107-21-jsmart2021@gmail.com>

List-ID: <linux-scsi.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org

Code inspection revealed stale comments in function headers for functions
that call lpfc_prep_els_iocb(). Changes in ndlp reference counting were
not reflected in function headers.

Update the stale comments in function headers to more accurately indicate
ndlp reference counting.
