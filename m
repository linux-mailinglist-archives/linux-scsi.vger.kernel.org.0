If that is case, some of these patches should be bug-fix, but nothing
about this kind of comment is provided. If it is true, please update
the commit log and explain the current issue in detail, such as,
what is the side-effect of 'overwriting the original command'?

And we might need to backport it to stable tree because storage error
recovery is very key function.

Even though it is true, still not sure if this patch is the correct
way to fix the issue cause IO performance drop might be caused.


Thanks,
Ming
