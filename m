Hi Can
Please forgive me for being verbose. 

The above BUG log is from your BUG_ON() called, not becuase of the race
betwen shutdown flow and sysfs node access(if I misunderstood, correct
me). But it tells that the user can still access UFS by sysfs node in
the "reboot -f" flow since it skips the actual shutdown process, "
--force" is not a safe way anyway.


If accessing sysfs nodes, which triggers a UFS UPIU request to
read/write UFS device descriptors during shutdown flow, there is only 
one issue that sysfs node access failure since UFS device and LINK has
been shutdown. Strictly speaking, the failure comes after
ufshcd_set_dev_pwr_mode().

   __ufshcd_query_descriptor: opcode 0x01 for idn 0 failed, index 0,
err = -11

Since the shutdown is oneway process, this failure is not big issue. If
you meant to avoid this failure for unsafe shutdown, I agree with you,
But for the race issue, I don't know.
