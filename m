The scan on this machine takes few seconds, the rmmod returns after
~300sec, that's not good.

A changed behavior also makes me doubt about this patch so let's look
into it. Some drivers may shorten the scanning time but many just wait
till scanning ends - internal mpts3sas driver
in 'scsih_remove' has this:
while (ioc->is_driver_loading)
	ssleep(1);
also smartpqi in 'pqi_wait_until_scan_finished' seems to be just
waiting. (Not tested that and I also haven't looked at other drivers.)
When scan starts the rmmod may fail also today when at that moment
scsi_device_get took the module reference - we change with this patch
the probability (only) from not likely to for sure.

If we want fix this we could instead review all drivers. A fix in a
called function can't be complete, in this case for example driver
removal may start (unlikely)before it's scan_start is called .
I still think that the scan code should protect the driver as it is
easier compared to a protection in every driver.
