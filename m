No, of course not. But the kernel should inspect all UAs especially the one
that says: CAPACITY DATA HAS CHANGED !

Nope, look up "format corrupt" state in SBC, there is a asc/ascq code for
that, and it was _not_ reported in this case. The disk was fine after those
two commands, it was sd or the scsi mid-level that didn't observe the UAs,
hence the snafu. Sending a READ command after a CAPACITY DATA HAS CHANGE
UA is "undefined behaviour" as the say in the C/C++ spec.

Also more and more settings in SCSI *** are giving the option to return an
error (even MEDIUM ERROR) if the initiator is reading a block that has never
been written. So if the sd driver is looking for a partition table (LBA 0 ?)
then you have a chicken and egg problem that retrying will not solve.

The sd driver should take its lead from SBC, not ZBC.

*** for example, FORMAT UNIT (FFMT=2)
