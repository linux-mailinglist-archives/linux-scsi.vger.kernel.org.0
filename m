Yes, and in many situations this may help.  But in the general case
we can't protect against a storage array misconfiguration,
where something like this can happen.  So I worry about people
believing the host software will protect them against a mistake,
when we can't really do that.

All it takes is one I/O (a discard) to make a thorough mess of the LUN.
