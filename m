Q: As libata starts up the drive internally via reset/revalidate, why do 
we have to sent START STOP UNIT for shutdown?
Wouldn't it be better to disable START STOP UNIT completely for libata, 
and let everything be handled via ATA command (IDLE IMMEDIATE, SLEEP) ?
Hmm?

Otherwise a really good idea. We've fallen into this trap several times 
ourselves.
Incidentally, USB could benefit from the same mechanism ...

Cheers,

Hannes
