 Umm, no.  As still quoted above I referred to ISA devices, such as the 
BT-545C.  ISA only has 24 address lines so no firmware change can make 
these devices address memory beyond 16MiB (whether as a bus master or with 
the aid of an 8237 DMA controller).

 As long as ISA support has been retained the BT-445S can just reuse the 
logic.

 I'm not strongly attached to ISA support though, and we continue 
supporting other SCSI HBAs for ISA.  But we do that even though they 
require a dedicated driver while with the unified MultiMaster architecture 
it would seem support for another host bus should be low-hanging fruit.
