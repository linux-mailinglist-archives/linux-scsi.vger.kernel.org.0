On second thought, actually the 1st fix alone is enough to eliminate the
race condition. Because blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() only iterates over all
requests which are not in IDLE state, if blk_mq_start_request() is 
called
within the protection of host spin lock, ufshcd_compl_tm() shall not run
into the scenario where req->end_io_data is set but 
REG_UTP_TASK_REQ_DOOR_BELL
has not been set. What do you think?
