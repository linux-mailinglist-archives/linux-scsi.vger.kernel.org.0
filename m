The scsi_debug driver having its store as a scatterlist has the
distinct advantage that the data-in and data-out buffers coming through
from the block layer and the scsi mid-level are also in the form of
scatterlists. Hence most of the media access SCSI commands that the
driver simulates boil down to just a handful of sgl to sgl operations.
The very ones that I am trying to add to the scatterlist API.

If there is some advantage of using huge pages for a store, then I
would prefer that to be done in the scatterlist API. Say a new
allocator like sgl_alloc_huge() that forms a scatter gather array
of huge pages.

I did have a quick look at huge pages and the existing kernel
infrastructure seemed to be aimed at user space usage rather than
driver usage.
