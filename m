To clarify, the dma-mapping API has two ways of dealing with this:

- the streaming API (dma_map/unmap_...) uses explicit cache flushes

- the coherent API (dma_alloc_coherent etc) uses page protections
  to prevent caching.

These three drivers use the streaming API because they operate on
data passed in from the outside, so the non-cacheable protection bits
are not used here.

Right, it seems that the old hack of passing a NULL device pointer
no longer works, and that is probably for the better.

If you want an easy way out, the driver can just call
platform_device_register_full() to create its own device with a
dma_mask set up, and use that device for the DMA API, but
not actually match the device to a driver.

Looks all good to me.
