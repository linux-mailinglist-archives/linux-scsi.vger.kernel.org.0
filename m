Understood.

I didn't really think this through. Sorry.

I've missed commit b0962c53bde9 ("scsi: core: avoid repetitive logging
of device offline messages") which should address the report I got in
our enterprise kernel. I was over eager to rate limit the 'dead
device' as well. It seem no need for this patch. Let me backport the
commit and see what our customer has to say.

Thanks for the help!
Daniel
