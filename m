Multiple people reported issues with freezes during suspend with kernel=20
v6.0-rc1. Please take a look at the following report:=20
https://lore.kernel.org/all/dd6844e7-f338-a4e9-2dad-0960e25b2ca1@redhat.com=
/.=20
It shows that if zoned ATA disks are present that blk_mq_freeze_queue()=20
may be called from inside ata_scsi_dev_rescan() on the context of a work=20
queue. ATA rescanning happens from inside the SCSI error handler. So=20
there is potential for a lockup because of the following:
* Execution of the START command being postponed because the SCSI error=20
handler is active.
* blk_mq_freeze_queue() waiting for the START command to finish.
* The START completion handler not being executed because it got queued=20
on the same work queue as the ATA rescan work.

Unfortunately I do not know enough about the ATA core to proceed. I need=20
help from an ATA expert.
