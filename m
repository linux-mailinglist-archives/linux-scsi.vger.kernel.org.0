Yes, that's what I observed. Mailbox access hangs in this case, as the
mailbox simply won't execute the command and the expected status change
will not happen.

I had that idea too. I even tried it out. IIRC it's not that easy. Some
commands need to be sent to the mailbox even in shut-down state
(MBC_EXECUTE_FIRMWARE, for example?). I admit I didn't dare going down
the path you're suggesting, I thought it had quite a potential to cause
regressions.

Did you mean this as a negative review, or rather an additional
suggestion?

Thanks
Martin
