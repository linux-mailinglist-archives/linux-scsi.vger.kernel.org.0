I didn't get this part. Why have the timeout? When the timeout expires, 
does userspace just call right back down to the kernel or does it do 
some sort of processing/operation?

You could have your worker function run from that ioctl wait for a 
signal or a wake up call from the vhost_work/poll functions.
