 Given the description it seems to me it will best be handled as a quirk 
in arch/alpha/kernel/pci.c, at least in the interim.

 If it turns out a generic issue with DAC handling in the Tsunami chipset, 
then a better approach would be a generic workaround for all potentially 
affected devices, but it does not appear we have existing infrastructure 
for that.  Just setting the global DMA mask would unnecessarily cripple 
64-bit option cards as well, but it seems to me there might be something 
relevant in arch/mips/pci/fixup-sb1250.c; see `quirk_sb1250_pci_dac' and 
the comments above it.

 The situation is a bit different here as the bus is a proper 64-bit one, 
but the quirk could only limit the individual DMA mask to 32 bits for 
devices that have no 64-bit memory BARs.  I suspect there are no proper 
64-bit PCI option cards that only have I/O bars and I don't think there's 
any explicit status bit to tell 32-bit and 64-bit option cards apart.

 FWIW I was able to obtain such an option card and try it with my HiFive 
Unmatched RISC-V system, which has 16GiB of RAM.  It turned out picky 
though and despite being DEC-branded it refused to talk to a number of 
SCSI 1 CCS DEC disks, which work just fine with an Adaptec host adapter 
using the same cables and with DECstation systems they came with, but also 
break with a BusLogic MultiMaster host adapter (which seems odd as these 
host adapters have been reputably very robust).

 So I could only do limited testing with a single SCSI 2 disk that works 
everywhere, and that triggered no issues.  As I wanted to retain remote 
access to said problematic disks from the Unmatched machine I have left 
them wired to the Adaptec device, but I'll see if I can do more testing at 
my next visit to the lab around the weekend after next as I'm going to 
disassemble the Unmatched system anyway.

 HTH,

  Maciej
