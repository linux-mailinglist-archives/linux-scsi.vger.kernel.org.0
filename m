I just looked at that commit for the first time.

Instead of making the SCSI driver do the work of deciding what routine to 
call, why not redefine blk_set_runtime_active(q) to simply call 
blk_post_runtime_resume(q, 0)?  Or vice versa: if err == 0 have 
blk_post_runtime_resume call blk_set_runtime_active?

After all, the two routines do almost the same thing -- and the bug 
addressed by this commit was caused by the difference in their behaviors.

If the device was already runtime-active during the system suspend, doing 
an extra clear of the pm_only counter won't hurt anything.

Martin's best approach would be to add some debugging code to find out why 
blk_queue_enter() isn't calling bkl_pm_request_resume(), or why that call 
doesn't lead to pm_request_resume().
