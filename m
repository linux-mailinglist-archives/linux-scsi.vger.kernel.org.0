You don't need this stanza.  xa_find() will do the right thing (ie return
NULL) with an empty array.

You don't need to use a 16-bit limit here; the XArray code will stop after
the end of the array, and the only thing you might save is scanning the top
node unnecessarily far.  To get there, you'd have to have an index >= 2^12,
and the additional limit would mean that you'd scan the first 16 entries of
the top node instead of all 64.  Kind of pales into insignificance compared
to actually walking all 2^12 elements up to that point ;-)

... to add, xa_for_each() is safe against deletion while walking.
Or addition while walking.

You aren't the first person to ask about having a 64-bit lookup on
32-bit machines.  Indeed, I remember Hannes asking for a 256 bit lookup
at LinuxCon in Prague.  I have always been reluctant to add such a thing because the XArray uses quite a naive data type underneath.  It works well with
dense arrays but becomes very wasteful of memory for sparse arrays.

My understanding of SCSI-world is that most devices have a single
LUN 0.  Most devices that have multiple LUNs number them sequentially.
Some devices have either an internal structure or essentially pick random
LUNs for the devices they expose.

I think this is currently the best way to use the XArray.  I do have
a project in the works to replace the data structure implementing the
XArray API with a better one, but that project has been underway for
almost two years now, so I would have a hard time suggesting that you
wait for it to be ready.

If you do only have a single entry at 0, the XArray is very efficient.
It simplifies to a single pointer.  You don't need to optimise for that
case yourself ;-)

By the way, you don't have to call xa_destroy() if you know the array
is empty.  The IDR used to have that unfortunate requirement, and about a
third of users blissfully ignored it, leaking uncounted amounts of memory.

I'm happy to have an xa_limit_16b in xarray.h.  I estimate it would have
about 5-10 users across the entire kernel.

It may make sense to use an allocating XArray for LUNs and targets, but
use the channel ID directly.  It depends how structured these things
are in SCSI, and I'll admit I haven't been keeping up with how SCSI
numbers things on a modern system (I suspect 99.9% of SCSI devices
are USB keys with one host, one channel, one target, one LUN, but
that the 0.1% of SCSI devices on Linux systems are responsible for 80%
of the performance end of the market)
