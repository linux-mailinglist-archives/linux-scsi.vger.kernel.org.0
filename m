I fully share your sentiments; this just feels so awkward, having to 
redo the logic in scsi_cmd_ioctl().

My original idea to that was to _use_ scsi_cmd_ioctl() directly from 
dm_blk_ioctl:

diff --git a/drivers/md/dm.c b/drivers/md/dm.c
index 50b693d776d6..007ff981f888 100644
--- a/drivers/md/dm.c
+++ b/drivers/md/dm.c
@@ -567,6 +567,9 @@ static int dm_blk_ioctl(struct block_device *bdev, 
fmode_t mode,
         struct mapped_device *md = bdev->bd_disk->private_data;
         int r, srcu_idx;

+       if (cmd == SG_IO)
+               return scsi_cmd_blk_ioctl(bdev, mode, cmd, arg);
+
         r = dm_prepare_ioctl(md, &srcu_idx, &bdev);
         if (r < 0)
                 goto out;


But that crashes horribly as sg_io() expects the request pdu to be of 
type 'scsi_request', which it definitely isn't here.

We _could_ prepend struct dm_rq_target_io with a struct scsi_request, 
seeing that basically _all_ dm-rq installations are on SCSI devices:

diff --git a/drivers/md/dm-rq.c b/drivers/md/dm-rq.c
index 13b4385f4d5a..aa7856621f83 100644

         struct mapped_device *md;
         struct dm_target *ti;
         struct request *orig, *clone;

Then the above should work, but we would increase the size of 
dm_rq_target_io by quite a lot. Although, given the current size of it, 
question is whether it matters...

Hmm?

Cheers,

Hannes
